# <type> defines a single type. It is usually a C typedef but
# may contain arbitrary C code.
# The attributes are more fully described in the registry schema document.
#
#   name - name of this type, if not present in the <name> tag
#   api - matches a <feature> api attribute, if present
#   alias - name of a type this type aliases
#   requires - name of another type definition required by this one
#   bitvalues - for a *Flags type, name of an enum definition that
#       defines the valid values for parameters of that type
#   category - if present, 'enum' indicates a matching <enums>
#       block to generate an enumerated type for, and 'struct'
#       causes special interpretation of the contents of the type
#       tag including ... TBD ...
#       Other allowed values are 'include', 'define', 'handle' and 'bitmask',
#       which do not change syntactic interpretation but allow organization
#       in the generated header.
#   deprecated - denotes that this type is deprecated, and why.
#       Valid values: 'aliased', 'true'.
#   parent - only applicable if category is 'handle'. Notes another type with
#       the 'handle' category that acts as a parent object for this type.
#   returnedonly - only applicable if category is 'struct'. Notes that this
#       struct is going to be filled in by the API, rather than an application
#       filling it out and passing it to the API.
#   structextends - only applicable if category is 'struct'. Lists parent
#       structures which this structure may extend via the pNext chain
#       of the parent.
#       When present it suppresses generation of automatic validity for the
#       pNext member of that structure, and instead the structure is added
#       to pNext chain validity for the parent structures it extends.
#   allowduplicate - only applicable if category is 'struct'. pNext can include
#       multiple structures of this type.
#   objtypeenum - name of VK_OBJECT_TYPE_* API enumerant which corresponds
#       to this type. Currently only specified for category="handle" types.
#   comment - descriptive text with no semantic meaning
# For types without a category, contents include
#   <apientry /> - substitutes for an APIENTRY-style macro on output
#   <name> - contains name of the type being defined
#   <type> - contains name of types used to define this type. There
#       may be multiple imbedded <type> tags
# For types with category 'enum', contents should be empty
# For types with category 'struct', contents should be one or more
#   <member> - like <param> for a struct or union member
#       len - if the member is an array, len may be one or more of the following
#           things, separated by commas (one for each array indirection):
#           another member of that struct, 'null-terminated' for a string,
#           '1' to indicate it is just a pointer (used for nested pointers),
#           or a latex equation (prefixed with 'latexmath:')
#       altlen - if len has latexmath equations, this contains equivalent C99
#                expressions separated by commas.
#       stride - if the member is an array, stride specifies the name of
#           another member containing the byte stride between consecutive
#           elements in the array. The array is assumed to be tightly packed
#           if omitted.
#       deprecated - denotes that this member is deprecated, and why.
#           Valid values: 'ignored', 'true'.
#       externsync - denotes that the member should be externally synchronized
#           when accessed by Vulkan
#       optional - whether this value can be omitted by providing NULL (for
#           pointers), VK_NULL_HANDLE (for handles) or 0 (for bitmasks/values)
#       selector - for a union member, identifies a separate enum member that
#           selects which of the union's members are valid
#       selection - for a member of a union, identifies an enum value indicating the member is valid
#       noautovalidity - tag stating that no automatic validity language should be generated
#       values - comma-separated list of legal values, usually used only for sType enums
#       limittype - only applicable for members of VkPhysicalDeviceProperties and
#           VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2, their substructures, and extensions.
#           Specifies the type of a device limit.
#           Valid values: 'min', 'max', 'not', 'pot', 'mul', 'bits', bitmask', 'range', 'struct', 'exact', 'noauto'
#       objecttype - only applicable for members representing a handle as
#           a uint64_t value. Specifies the name of another member which is
#           a VkObjectType or VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT value specifying
#           the type of object the handle references.
#       featurelink - only applicable for members representing a Boolean API
#           feature. Specifies that the feature has a link in the
#           specification that does not match the name of the feature.
#           Typically for features in extensions that were later promoted but
#           with changes.

# form has more possible attributes. Some combinations of attributes are
# nonsensical in on or the other place, but these are not detected by the
# validator.
#
# Ways to specify the enumerant value:
#   value - integer (including hex) value of the enumerant
#   bitpos - integer bit position of the enumerant in a bitmask
#   [extnumber], offset, [dir] - integer extension number specifying a
#       base block value (inherited from surrounding <extension> if
#       not specified); integer offset in that block; and direction
#       of offset ('-' for negative, positive if not specified).
#   alias - name of another enum this is an alias of
#
# value and bitpos allow, and extnumber/offset/dir require:
#   extends - type name of the enumerant being extended
#
# Other attributes:
#   api - matches a <feature> api attribute, if present
#   type - 'uint32_t', 'uint64_t', or 'float', if present. There are
#       certain conditions under which the tag must be present, or absent,
#       but they are context-dependent and difficult to express in the
#       RNC syntax.
#   name - enumerant name
#   alias - another enumerant this is semantically identical to
#   protect - additional #ifdef symbol to place around the enum
#   comment - descriptive text with no semantic meaning
#   deprecated - denotes that this enum is deprecated, and why.

#
#   <proto> is the C function prototype, including the return type
#   <param> are function parameters, in order
#     len - if the member is an array, len may be one or more of the following
#           things, separated by commas (one for each array indirection):
#           another member of that struct, 'null-terminated' for a string,

#     altlen - if len has latexmath equations, this contains equivalent C99
#              expressions separated by commas.
#     stride - if the member is an array, stride specifies the name of
#         another parameter containing the byte stride between consecutive
#         elements in the array. The array is assumed to be tightly packed
#         if omitted.
#     externsync - denotes that the member should be externally synchronized
#         when accessed by Vulkan
#     optional - whether this value can be omitted by providing NULL (for
#         pointers), VK_NULL_HANDLE (for handles) or 0 (for bitmasks/values)
#     selector - for a union parameter, identifies a separate enum parameter that
#         selects which of the union's members are valid
#     noautovalidity - tag stating that no automatic validity language should be
#         generated
#     objecttype - only applicable for parameters representing a handle as
#         a uint64_t value. Specifies the name of another parameter which is
#         a VkObjectType or VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT value specifying
#         the type of object the handle references.
#     validstructs - only applicable for parameters which are pointers to
#         VkBaseInStructure or VkBaseOutStructure types, used as abstract
#         placeholders. Specifies a comma-separated list of structures which
#         may be passed in place of the parameter, or anywhere in the pNext
#         chain of the parameter.
#     <type> is a <type> name, if present
#     <name> is the function / parameter name, if present (normally should
#         be, except for void parameters).
# The textual contents of <proto> and <param> should be legal C
# for those parts of a function declaration.
#   <alias> - denotes function aliasing, if present
#     name - name of aliased function
#   <description> - unused text
#   <implicitexternsyncparams> are spec-language descriptions of
#       objects that are not parameters of the command, but
#       are related to them and also require external synchronization.

# Each <videocodec> element defines either a video codec category or a
# specific video codec that can be used in the API.
# Video codec categories are defined with a <videocodec> element with a
# single name attribute specifying the video codec category (such as decode
# or encode).
# Specific video codecs are defined with a <videocodec> element with the
# following attributes:
#   name - descriptive name of the specific video codec
#   extend - descriptive name of the video codec category it specializes
#   value - the VkVideoCodecOperationFlagBitsKHR value identifying the codec
#
# Each <videocapabilities> element defines a video capability structure that
# is supported by the video codec and has a single struct attribute
# identifying the video capability structure.
#
# Each <videoformat> element defines a video format category that is
# supported by the video codec. If this is a new video format category
# (typically defined in video codec categories), the following attributes
# are required:
#   name - descriptive name of the video format category
#   usage - image usage flags expected to be specified in
#       VkPhysicalDeviceVideoFormatInfoKHR::imageUsage to query the format
#       properties for the video format category ("," and "+" can be used to
#       express disjunction and conjunction, respectively)
# In case a specific video codec extends the video format category with
# additional codec-specific information, the descriptive name of the
# extended video format category is specified through a single extend
# attribute.
# Video format properties supported by the video format category are
# defined with <videoformatproperties> elements with a single struct
# attribute identifying the video format properties structure.
# If the video format category is dependent on some capability, then
# <videorequirecapabilities> elements can be included in them with the
# following attributes:
#   struct - name of the capability structure used to determine the
#       precondition
#   member - name of the capability structure member used to determine the
#       precondition
#   value - the value the member should have to meet the precondition
#       ("," and "+" can be used to express disjunction and conjunction,
#       respectively)
# If more <videorequirecapabilities> elements are specified, then the
# overall precondition is the conjunction of the individual preconditions.
#
# Specific video profiles supported by a video codec are declared by a
# <videoprofiles> element with a single struct attribute identifying the
# codec-specific video profile structure. For each member of the specified
# profile structure, a <videoprofilemember> element is expected to be
# included with the name attribute specifying the name of the video profile
# structure member.
# Each <profile> element defined in a <member> element has the following
# attributes:
#   name - descriptive name of the profile
#   value - value of the member in case of this profile
# Some codec-specific video profile structures have multiple members. In
# such cases the complete definition and name of specific video profiles
# is constructed by combinations of the <profile> elements of each member.
