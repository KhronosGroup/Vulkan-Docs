such is not a ratified Specification, though it contains text from (and is a
superset of) the ratified {apinameCR} Specification. The ratified versions

// "Successor Specification" section

This Specification contains substantially unmodified functionality from, and
is a successor to, Khronos specifications including
ifdef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[Vulkan, OpenGL SC]
OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenCL.

// "Normative Wording" section

The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy defines the terms 'Scope',
'Compliant Portion', and 'Necessary Patent Claims'.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED
the Scope of this Specification. The <<introduction-conventions>> section of
the <<introduction>> defines how these parts of the Specification are
identified.

Where this Specification uses <<introduction-technical-terminology,
technical terminology>>, defined in the <<glossary, Glossary>> or otherwise,
that refer to enabling technologies that are not expressly set forth in this
Specification, those enabling technologies are EXCLUDED from the Scope of
this Specification. For clarity, enabling technologies not disclosed with
particularity in this Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing
technology, hardware architecture, processor architecture or
microarchitecture, memory architecture, compiler technology, object oriented
technology, basic operating system technology, compression technology,
algorithms, and so on) are NOT to be considered expressly set forth; only
those application program interfaces and data structures disclosed with
particularity are included in the Scope of this Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it
relates to the definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or
optional features, behaviors and functionality set forth in this
Specification, if implemented, are considered to be included as Compliant
Portions.

// "Normative References" section

Where this Specification identifies specific sections of external
references, only those specifically identified sections define
<<introduction-normative-references, normative>>
functionality. The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy excludes
external references to materials and associated enabling technology not
created by Khronos from the Scope of this Specification, and any licenses
that may be required to implement such referenced materials and associated
technologies must be obtained separately and may involve royalty payments.

// This is version V10_Feb23 of the Khronos Specification Copyright License
// Header, adapted for asciidoc markup and for the specific requirements of
// the Vulkan Specification:
//
// - The "Ratified Specifications" language is surrounding by mutually
//   exclusive conditional directives, allowing either form to be included
//   in the output Specifications depending on which extension(s) they are
//   built with. The non-ratified section includes links to the ratified
//   Vulkan 1.3 Specifications in the Vulkan Registry.
// - The "Successor Specification" section cites OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and
//   OpenCL.
// - The "Normative Wording" section links to the Vulkan Specification
//   introduction instead of the "[Document Conventions]" placeholder, and
//   links to sections describing technical terminology and the glossary.
// - The "Normative References" section links to the "Normative References"
//   section of the Specification.
// - The trademarks section cites only those trademarks relevant to Vulkan.
