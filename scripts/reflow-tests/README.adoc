= Reflow Tests

This directory contains test source and expectation files for the `reflow.py`
script. These files are used by the tests in `test_reflow.py`, which is run as
part of `pytest`.

The tests reflow each source file (`src-<name>.adoc`) with multiple
configurations (with or without VUID assignment, with or without reflowing the
text), and match them against the expectation (`expect-<name>-<options>.adoc`).

After running `pytest`, if any `test_reflow.py` test fails for example because
the reflow script has been modified to function differently, the test results
can be found under `results/<options>/src-<name>.adoc` and needs to be manually
reviewed for correctness. Once correctness of new results are verified, the
expectations can be updated with:

$ ./update-expectations
