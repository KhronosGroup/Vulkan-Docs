.Interpretation of Numeric Format
[width="95%",cols="2,3,10",options="header"]
|====
| Numeric format | SPIR-V _Sampled Type_ | Description
| etext:UNORM    | OpTypeFloat           | The components are unsigned normalized values in the range [eq]#[0,1]#
| etext:SNORM    | OpTypeFloat           | The components are signed normalized values in the range [eq]#[-1,1]#
| etext:USCALED  | OpTypeFloat           | The components are unsigned integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SSCALED  | OpTypeFloat           | The components are signed integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UINT     | OpTypeInt             | The components are unsigned integer values in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SINT     | OpTypeInt             | The components are signed integer values in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UFLOAT   | OpTypeFloat           | The components are unsigned floating-point numbers (used by packed, shared exponent, and some compressed formats)
| etext:SFLOAT   | OpTypeFloat           | The components are signed floating-point numbers
| etext:SRGB     | OpTypeFloat           | The R, G, and B components are unsigned normalized values that represent values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A component (if one exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
3+| [eq]#n# is the number of bits in the component.
|====

The suffix etext:_PACKnn indicates that the format is packed into an underlying type with etext:nn bits.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]
The suffix etext:_mPACKnn is a short-hand that indicates that the format has etext:m groups of components (which may or may not be stored in separate _planes_) that are each packed into an underlying type with etext:nn bits.
