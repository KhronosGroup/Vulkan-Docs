.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-aspectMask-02498]]
    The slink:VkImageSubresourceRange::pname:aspectMask members of the
    elements of the pname:pRanges array must: each only include
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-baseMipLevel-01470]]
    The slink:VkImageSubresourceRange::pname:baseMipLevel members of the
    elements of the pname:pRanges array must: each be less than the
    pname:mipLevels specified in slink:VkImageCreateInfo when pname:image
    was created
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-pRanges-02498]]
    For each slink:VkImageSubresourceRange element of pname:pRanges, if the
    pname:levelCount member is not ename:VK_REMAINING_MIP_LEVELS, then
    [eq]#pname:baseMipLevel {plus} pname:levelCount# must: be less than or
    equal to the pname:mipLevels specified in slink:VkImageCreateInfo when
    pname:image was created
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-baseArrayLayer-00007]]
    The slink:VkImageSubresourceRange::pname:baseArrayLayer members of the
    elements of the pname:pRanges array must: each be less than the
    pname:arrayLayers specified in slink:VkImageCreateInfo when pname:image
    was created
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-pRanges-02498]]
    For each slink:VkImageSubresourceRange element of pname:pRanges, if the
    pname:layerCount member is not ename:VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS, then
    [eq]#pname:baseArrayLayer {plus} pname:layerCount# must: be less than or
    equal to the pname:arrayLayers specified in slink:VkImageCreateInfo when
    pname:image was created
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-image-00007]]
    pname:image must: not have a compressed or depth/stencil format
  * [[VUID-vkCmdClearColorImage-pColor-02498]]
    pname:pColor must: be a valid pointer to a slink:VkClearColorValue union
