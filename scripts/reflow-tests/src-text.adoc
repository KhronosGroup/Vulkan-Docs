= Formats

Supported buffer and image formats may: vary across implementations.
A minimum set of format features are guaranteed, but others must: be explicitly queried before use to ensure they are supported by the implementation.

The features for the set of formats (elink:VkFormat) supported by the implementation are queried individually using the flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties command.
