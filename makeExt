# makeBranch - invoke Makefile with the right options to build with a
# specific extension or extensions included. The extension currently
# must be a single argument, but that argument may contain a quoted,
# space-separated list of extension names.
#
# Dependencies on other extensions are automatically added. This
# script requires features introduced in bash 4.0.
#
# Usage: makeBranch extension targets

# Load extension dependencies, generated from vk.xml
make config/extDependency.sh || exit
source config/extDependency.sh

extension=$1
shift
echo extension is $extension targets are $*

# Determine the set of required extensions based on requested extensions
declare -A required

# Allow multiple extension names in a single argument
for name in $extension ; do
    # Add to the required list

    # If it has dependencies, add all of them to the required list
    if [ ${extensions[$name]+_} ] ; then
