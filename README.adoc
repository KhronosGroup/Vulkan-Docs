== Building the Specification and Reference Pages

The document sources are marked up in Asciidoctor format, and we use
`asciidoctor` and related toolchain components to generate output documents.
See link:BUILD.adoc[BUILD.adoc] for more information on installing the
toolchain and building the Specification.


== Generating Headers and Related Files

See link:xml/README.adoc[xml/README.adoc].

The header files (`include/vulkan/vulkan*.h`) and many parts of the
specification and reference page documents are generated from descriptions
in the XML API Registry (link:xml/vk.xml[`xml/vk.xml`]).
The generated files are not checked into the repository.
If you change `vk.xml`, you can regenerate the headers by going into
`xml/` and running:

    $ make clean install

The other generated files are built as required via dependencies in
the top-level `Makefile`.
