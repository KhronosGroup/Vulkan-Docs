Vulkan^(R)^ API Documentation Project
=====================================

This repository contains formal documentation of the Vulkan API. This
includes the main API Specification, the reference (man) pages, the XML API
Registry, and related tools and scripts.

Single-Branch Model
-------------------

As of the 1.0.25 release, we have switched to a new "`single-branch`" model
in which all extensions are included in the source of the 1.0 branch of the
Specification, and can be configured in or out of the build using Makefile
options.

Repository Structure
--------------------

```
README.adoc             This file
ChangeLog.txt           Change log summary for each public spec update

        appendices/     Appendices - one file each
        chapters/       Chapters - one file each

        man/            Reference (manual) pages for API, mostly extracted from the spec source
    misc/               Related specifications (GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl)
src/spec/               XML API Registry (vk.xml) and related scripts
src/vulkan/             Vulkan headers, generated from the Registry
```

Building the Specification and Reference Pages
----------------------------------------------

As of the 1.0.40 release, we have moved from the old `asciidoc` toolchain to
a new one based on `asciidoctor`. See `doc/specs/vulkan/README.adoc` for
more information on installing the toolchain and building the Specification.

Generating Headers and Related Files
------------------------------------

The header file (`src/vulkan/vulkan.h`) and many parts of the specification
and reference page documents are generated from descriptions in the XML API
Registry (`src/spec/vk.xml`). The generated files, with the exception of
`vulkan.h`, are not checked into the repository. If you change `vk.xml`, you
can regenerate the header by going to `src/spec` and running:

    $ make clobber install

The other generated files are built as required via dependencies in
`doc/specs/vulkan/Makefile` .

------------------------------------
中文翻译的版本，以v1.0.41-core这个release为蓝本，估计这个翻译工作将持续一段时间，等到
Vulkan Spec有重大更新了，中文版再跟进。
