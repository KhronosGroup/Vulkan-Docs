= Vulkan^(R)^ API Documentation Project

This repository contains sources for the formal documentation of the Vulkan
API. This includes:

[options="compact"]
 * The Vulkan API Specification
 * Specification of Vulkan extensions
 * API reference ("`man`") pages
 * The XML API Registry (also mirrored at
   https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers)
 * Vulkan header files (also mirrored at
   https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers)
 * Related tools and scripts.

The authoritative public repository is located at
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/.
It hosts a public Issue tracker, and outside developers can file proposed
patches (Pull Requests) against the Specification, subject to approval
by Khronos.

If in doubt where to submit your Issue, consult the
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Ecosystem repo.


== Branch Structure

The current Specification is maintained in the `master` branch of the
repository.
From this branch it is possible to generate Specifications for any published
version of Vulkan (1.2, 1.1, and 1.0), and incorporating any desired set of
extensions.
Each published update is tagged in the form `1.2.*release*` where *release*
is a constantly incrementing release number and `1.2` is the latest
published version of the API.
The last public spec update prior to Vulkan 1.2 is tagged `v1.1.130`.

The last state of the `master` branch in Khronos' internal gitlab server,
before 1.2 content was merged into it, is tagged `1.1-archive` (this tag is
not in github).

```


== Building the Specification and Reference Pages

The document sources are marked up in Asciidoctor format, and we use
`asciidoctor` and related toolchain components to generate output documents.
See link:BUILD.adoc[BUILD.adoc] for more information on installing the
toolchain and building the Specification.


== Generating Headers and Related Files

See link:xml/README.adoc[xml/README.adoc].

The header files (`include/vulkan/vulkan*.h`) and many parts of the
specification and reference page documents are generated from descriptions
in the XML API Registry (`xml/vk.xml`).
The generated files are not checked into the repository.
If you change `vk.xml`, you can regenerate the headers by going into
`xml/` and running:

    $ make clean install

The other generated files are built as required via dependencies in
the top-level `Makefile`.
