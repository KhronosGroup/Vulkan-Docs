= Vulkan Feature Descriptions

This component includes all published extension feature descriptions, as
well as the original rationale for the xref:proposals/Roadmap.adoc[Vulkan
Roadmap] process which resulted in the
xref:spec::appendices/roadmap.adoc[Roadmap 2022 and Roadmap 2024] milestones.

When a Vulkan extension begins development, a "`proposal`" document is
written outlining the proposed API.
The proposal is the basis from which specification language is written.

When the extension is published, the proposal - now referred to as a
"`feature description`" - is retained to act as supplementary documentation
on that extension.
