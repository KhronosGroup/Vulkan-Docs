= Vulkan Roadmap and Feature Descriptions

This component includes the Vulkan Roadmap, the Vulkan 2022 Profile Roadmap,
and all published extension feature descriptions.

When a Vulkan extension is initially proposed, a feature description is
written outlining the proposed API, from which specification language is
written.
Once the extension is published, the initial &quot;proposal&quot;, now
referred to as a &quot;feature description&quot;, is retained to act as
supplementary documentation on that extension.
