= Vulkan Documentation Project Demo

include::{config}/attribs.adoc[]
include::{generated}/specattribs.adoc[]

== Status (2023-04-02)

This site is a proof of concept showing how to get several of our Vulkan
specifications, proposals, and guides into a single integrated documentation
site.
Feedback is welcome.

Status:

  * Substantially complete - all content for a full Vulkan 1.3 core {plus}
    all extensions Specification is included here.
  * Internal links between pages should work, although the different
    modules are not heavily crosslinked.
  * Math mostly works, although more complex constructions using the LaTeX
    AMS `{aligned}` environments are not supported yet due to some MathJax
    misconfiguration deep in the guts of an asciidoctor.js extension.
  * UI and CSS are out-of-the box Antora defaults, which will need to be
    updated and reconfigured for Khronos needs.
  * Currently, building the site requires local repository clones of the
    components (Vulkan specification, proposals, and guide). Eventually we
    will make use of Antora Collector, which will allow pulling branches to
    build directly from github.

Incorporation of additional components such as the SPIR-V Specification will
require more authoring work, and discussion with the relevant working
groups.


== Navigation

The left sidebar links to pages in the current "`module`" - spec /
proposals, or guide. "`pages`" map onto chapters in the Vulkan
Specification.
As currently configured, the spec and proposals are two separate modules in
the same repository, so they both appear in the same sidebar (proposals are
way down at the bottom - keep scrolling).

The right sidebar is sections within the current page.

The bottom-left button switches between modules. Pages can also directly
crosslink between modules, such as these links to the
xref:spec:proposals:index.adoc[Vulkan Proposals] and
xref:guide::index.adoc[Vulkan Guide] module start pages.

The top contains a text searchbar using the Antora Lunr extension.
It will suggest matches to search terms
found in all of the modules of the site.


== Implementation

The goals of this demo are:

  * Demonstrate several Vulkan document sets integrated in Antora
  ** Done.
  * Show that Antora can be used with our documents without significantly
    impacting the existing spec markup, toolchain, and outputs.
  ** Done. The demo is not built from a specification repository fork. It is
     using current `main` branch with an Antora overlay which provide the
     basic document structure and a set of scripts which do light
     transformations on spec chapters and appendices to Antora conventions.
  ** This means there need be no impact of Antora to ongoing spec
     development activity, including generating Promoter ratification
     candidates.


== Future Plans

In the near term:

  * Fix math rendering issues
  * Improve navigation / add additional resources in top navbar
  * Possibly alter the site theme to something closer to the current Vulkan
    Specification
  * Incorporate feedback from the developer community

In the longer term, our hope is that this approach to publishing Vulkan
documentation can eventually be used to replace the separate sites and
documents we use to publish today, and that we can add more modules with
other types of Vulkan and Vulkan-adjacent documentation.
