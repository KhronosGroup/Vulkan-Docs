To enable or disable low latency mode on a swapchain, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkSetLatencySleepModeNV.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the device associated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to enable or disable low latency mode
    on.
  * pname:pSleepModeInfo is `NULL` or a pointer to a
    slink:VkLatencySleepModeInfoNV structure specifying the parameters of
    the latency sleep mode.

If pname:pSleepModeInfo is `NULL`, fname:vkSetLatencySleepModeNV will
disable low latency mode, low latency boost, and set the minimum present
interval previously specified by slink:VkLatencySleepModeInfoNV to zero on
pname:swapchain.
As an exception to the normal rules for objects which are externally
synchronized, the swapchain passed to fname:vkSetLatencySleepModeNV may: be
simultaneously used by other threads in calls to functions other than
flink:vkDestroySwapchainKHR.
Access to the swapchain data associated with this extension must: be atomic
within the implementation.

The sname:VkLatencySleepModeInfoNV structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkLatencySleepModeInfoNV.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:lowLatencyMode is the toggle to enable or disable low latency
    mode.
  * pname:lowLatencyBoost allows an application to hint to the GPU to
    increase performance to provide additional latency savings at a cost of
    increased power consumption.
  * pname:minimumIntervalUs is the microseconds between
    flink:vkQueuePresentKHR calls for a given swapchain that
    flink:vkLatencySleepNV will enforce.

If pname:lowLatencyMode is set to ename:VK_FALSE, pname:lowLatencyBoost will
still hint to the GPU to increase its power state and fname:vkLatencySleepNV
will still enforce pname:minimumIntervalUs between fname:vkQueuePresentKHR
calls.

To provide the synchronization primitive used to delay host CPU work for
lower latency rendering, call:

  * pname:device is the device associated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to delay associated CPU work based on

CPU work refers to application work done before presenting which includes
but is not limited to: input sampling, simulation, command buffer recording,
command buffer submission, and present submission.

An application can: provide timestamps at various stages of its frame
generation work by calling:
