== Optical Flow Queues

`apiext:VK_NV_optical_flow` adds a optical flow queue type bit
ename:VK_QUEUE_OPTICAL_FLOW_BIT_NV to elink:VkQueueFlagBits.
Optical flow operations are supported by queues with an advertised queue
capability of ename:VK_QUEUE_OPTICAL_FLOW_BIT_NV.
As in the case of other queue types, an application must: use
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties to query whether the physical
device has support for the Optical Flow Queue.
When the implementation reports the ename:VK_QUEUE_OPTICAL_FLOW_BIT_NV bit
for a queue family, it advertises general support for Vulkan queue
operations described in <<devsandqueues, Devices and Queues>>.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceOpticalFlowImageFormatsNV',desc='Query image formats for optical flow',type='protos']
--
To enumerate the supported image formats for a specific optical flow usage,
call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceOpticalFlowImageFormatsNV.adoc[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device being queried.
  * [[opticalflow-getimageformat-pOpticalFlowImageFormatInfo]]
    pname:pOpticalFlowImageFormatInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkOpticalFlowImageFormatInfoNV structure specifying the optical
    flow usage for which information is returned.
  * [[opticalflow-getimageformat-pFormatCount]] pname:pFormatCount is a
    pointer to an integer related to the number of optical flow properties
    available or queried, as described below.
  * [[opticalflow-getimageformat-pImageFormatProperties]]
    pname:pImageFormatProperties is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkOpticalFlowImageFormatPropertiesNV structures in which supported
    formats and image parameters are returned.

If pname:pImageFormatProperties is `NULL`, then the number of optical flow
properties supported for the given pname:physicalDevice is returned in
pname:pFormatCount.
Otherwise, pname:pFormatCount must point to a variable set by the user to
the number of elements in the pname:pImageFormatProperties array, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually
written to pname:pImageFormatProperties.
If the value of pname:pFormatCount is less than the number of optical flow
properties supported, at most pname:pFormatCount values will be written to
pname:pImageFormatProperties, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available values
were returned.
Before creating an image to be used as a optical flow frame, obtain the
supported image creation parameters by querying with
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2 and
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 using one of the reported
formats and adding slink:VkOpticalFlowImageFormatInfoNV to the pname:pNext
chain of slink:VkPhysicalDeviceImageFormatInfo2.
When querying the parameters with
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 for images used for optical
flow operations, the slink:VkOpticalFlowImageFormatInfoNV::pname:usage field
should contain one or more of the bits defined in
elink:VkOpticalFlowUsageFlagBitsNV.
