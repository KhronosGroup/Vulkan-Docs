To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a dlink:CAMetalLayer, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateMetalSurfaceEXT.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance with which to associate the surface.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkMetalSurfaceCreateInfoEXT structure containing the parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The slink:VkMetalSurfaceCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkMetalSurfaceCreateInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:pLayer is a reference to a dlink:CAMetalLayer object that
    represents a renderable surface.

To remove an unnecessary compile-time dependency, an incomplete type
definition of dlink:CAMetalLayer is provided in the Vulkan headers:

include::../../api/defines/CAMetalLayer.txt[]

The actual dlink:CAMetalLayer type is defined in the QuartzCore framework.
