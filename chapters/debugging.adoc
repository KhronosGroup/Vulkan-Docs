To aid developers in tracking down errors in the application's use of
Vulkan, particularly in combination with an external debugger or profiler,
_debugging extensions_ may be available.

[open,refpage='VkObjectType',desc='Specify an enumeration to track object handle types',type='enums']

The elink:VkObjectType enumeration defines values, each of which corresponds
to a specific Vulkan handle type.
These values can: be used to associate debug information with a particular
type of object through one or more extensions.

=== Device Fault Diagnosis

[open,refpage='vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT',desc='Reports diagnostic fault information on the specified logical device',type='protos']
--
To retrieve diagnostic information about faults that may: have caused device
loss, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device from which to query the diagnostic
    fault information.
  * pname:pFaultCounts is a pointer to a slink:VkDeviceFaultCountsEXT
    structure in which counts for structures describing additional fault
    information are returned.
  * pname:pFaultInfo is `NULL` or a pointer to a slink:VkDeviceFaultInfoEXT
    structure in which fault information is returned.

If pname:pFaultInfo is `NULL`, then the counts of corresponding additional
fault information structures available are returned in the
pname:addressInfoCount and pname:vendorInfoCount members of
pname:pFaultCounts.
Additionally, the size of any vendor-specific binary crash dump is returned
in the pname:vendorBinarySize member of pname:pFaultCounts.

If pname:pFaultInfo is not `NULL`, pname:pFaultCounts must: point to a
slink:VkDeviceFaultCountsEXT structure with each structure count or size
member (pname:addressInfoCount, pname:vendorInfoCount,
pname:vendorBinarySize) set by the user to the number of elements in the
corresponding output array member of pname:pFaultInfo (pname:pAddressInfos
and pname:pVendorInfos), or to the size of the output buffer in bytes
(pname:pVendorBinaryData).
On return, each structure count member is overwritten with the number of
structures actually written to the corresponding output array member of
pname:pFaultInfo.
Similarly, pname:vendorBinarySize is overwritten with the number of bytes
actually written to the pname:pVendorBinaryData member of pname:pFaultInfo.

If the <<features-deviceFaultVendorBinary, vendor-specific crash dumps>>
feature is not enabled, then implementations must: set
pname:pFaultCounts\->vendorBinarySize to zero and must: not modify
pname:pFaultInfo\->pVendorBinaryData.

If any pname:pFaultCounts structure count member is less than the number of
corresponding fault properties available, at most structure count
(pname:addressInfoCount, pname:vendorInfoCount) elements will be written to
the associated pname:pFaultInfo output array.
Similarly, if pname:vendorBinarySize is less than the size in bytes of the
available crash dump data, at most pname:vendorBinarySize elements will be
written to pname:pVendorBinaryData.

If pname:pFaultInfo is `NULL`, then subsequent calls to
flink:vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT for the same pname:device must: return
identical values in the pname:addressInfoCount, pname:vendorInfoCount and
pname:vendorBinarySize members of pname:pFaultCounts.

If pname:pFaultInfo is not `NULL`, then subsequent calls to
flink:vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT for the same pname:device must: return
identical values in the output members of pname:pFaultInfo
(pname:pAddressInfos, pname:pVendorInfos, pname:pVendorBinaryData), up to
the limits described by the structure count and buffer size members of
pname:pFaultCounts (pname:addressInfoCount, pname:vendorInfoCount,
pname:vendorBinarySize).
If the sizes of the output members of pname:pFaultInfo increase for a
subsequent call to flink:vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT, then supplementary
information may: be returned in the additional available space.

If any pname:pFaultCounts structure count member is smaller than the number
of corresponding fault properties available, or if
pname:pFaultCounts\->vendorBinarySize is smaller than the size in bytes of
the generated binary crash dump data, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available
properties were returned.

If pname:pFaultCounts\->vendorBinarySize is less than what is necessary to
store the <<vendor-binary-crash-dumps, binary crash dump header>>, nothing
will be written to pname:pFaultInfo\->pVendorBinaryData and zero will be
written to pname:pFaultCounts\->vendorBinarySize.

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:description is an array of ename:VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE code:char
    containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is a human readable
    description of the fault.
  * pname:pAddressInfos is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDeviceFaultAddressInfoEXT structures describing either memory
    accesses which may: have caused a page fault, or describing active
    instruction pointers at the time of the fault.
    If not `NULL`, each element of pname:pAddressInfos describes the a
    bounded region of GPU virtual address space containing either the GPU
    virtual address accessed, or the value of an active instruction pointer.
  * pname:pVendorInfos is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDeviceFaultVendorInfoEXT structures describing vendor-specific
    fault information.
  * pname:pVendorBinaryData is `NULL` or a pointer to pname:vendorBinarySize
    number of bytes of data, which will be populated with a vendor-specific
    binary crash dump, as described in <<vendor-binary-crash-dumps, Vendor
    Binary Crash Dumps>>.

An implementation should: populate as many members of
slink:VkDeviceFaultInfoEXT as possible, given the information available at
the time of the fault and the constraints of the implementation itself.

Due to hardware limitations, pname:pAddressInfos describes ranges of GPU
virtual address space, rather than precise addresses.
The precise memory address accessed or the precise value of the instruction
pointer must: lie within the region described.

ifdef::VK_EXT_device_address_binding_report[]
[NOTE]
.Note
====
Each element of pname:pAddressInfos describes either:

  * A memory access which may have triggered a page fault and may have
    contributed to device loss
  * The value of an active instruction pointer at the time a fault occurred.
    This value may be indicative of the active pipeline or shader at the
    time of device loss

Comparison of the GPU virtual addresses described by pname:pAddressInfos to
GPU virtual address ranges reported by the
`apiext:VK_EXT_device_address_binding_report` extension may allow
applications to correlate between these addresses and Vulkan objects.
Applications should be aware that these addresses may also correspond to
resources internal to an implementation, which will not be reported via the
`apiext:VK_EXT_device_address_binding_report` extension.

  * pname:addressType is either the type of memory operation that triggered
    a page fault, or the type of association between an instruction pointer
    and a fault.
  * pname:reportedAddress is the GPU virtual address recorded by the device.
  * pname:addressPrecision is a power of two value that specifies how
    precisely the device can report the address.

the possible range of addresses to be calculated, such that:

[[vendor-binary-crash-dumps]]
==== Vendor Binary Crash Dumps

Applications can: store the vendor-specific binary crash dump data retrieved
by calling flink:vkGetDeviceFaultInfoEXT for later analysis using external
tools.

However, the format of this data may: depend on the vendor ID, device ID,
driver version, and other details of the device.
To enable external applications to identify the original device from which a
crash dump was generated, the initial bytes written to
sname:VkDeviceFaultInfoEXT::pname:pVendorBinaryData must: begin with a valid
crash dump header.

[open,refpage='VkDeviceFaultVendorBinaryHeaderVersionOneEXT',desc='Structure describing the layout of the vendor binary crash dump header',type='structs']
--
Version one of the crash dump header is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkDeviceFaultVendorBinaryHeaderVersionOneEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:headerSize is the length in bytes of the crash dump header.
  * pname:headerVersion is a elink:VkDeviceFaultVendorBinaryHeaderVersionEXT
    enum value specifying the version of the header.
    A consumer of the crash dump should: use the header version to interpret
    the remainder of the header.
  * pname:vendorID is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:vendorID
    of the implementation.
  * pname:deviceID is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:deviceID
    of the implementation.
  * pname:driverVersion is the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:driverVersion of the
    implementation.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is an array of ename:VK_UUID_SIZE code:uint8_t
    values matching the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:pipelineCacheUUID property of
    the implementation.
  * pname:applicationNameOffset is zero, or an offset from the base address
    of the crash dump header to a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing
    the name of the application.
    If pname:applicationNameOffset is non-zero, this string must: match the
    application name specified via
    slink:VkApplicationInfo::pname:pApplicationName during instance
    creation.
  * pname:applicationVersion must: be zero or the value specified by
    slink:VkApplicationInfo::pname:applicationVersion during instance
    creation.
  * pname:engineNameOffset is zero, or an offset from the base address of
    the crash dump header to a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the
    name of the engine (if any) used to create the application.
    If pname:engineNameOffset is non-zero, this string must: match the
    engine name specified via slink:VkApplicationInfo::pname:pEngineName
    during instance creation.
  * pname:engineVersion must: be zero or the value specified by
    slink:VkApplicationInfo::pname:engineVersion during instance creation.
  * pname:apiVersion must: be zero or the value specified by
    slink:VkApplicationInfo::pname:apiVersion during instance creation.

Unlike most structures declared by the Vulkan API, all fields of this
structure are written with the least significant byte first, regardless of
host byte-order.

The C language specification does not define the packing of structure
members.
This layout assumes tight structure member packing, with members laid out in
the order listed in the structure, and the intended size of the structure is
56 bytes.
If a compiler produces code that diverges from that pattern, applications
must: employ another method to set values at the correct offsets.
