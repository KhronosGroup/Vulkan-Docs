= Execution Graphs

_Execution graphs_ provide a way for applications to dispatch multiple
operations dynamically from a single initial command on the host.
To achieve this, a new execution graph pipeline is provided, that links
together multiple shaders or pipelines which each describe one or more
operations that can be dispatched within the execution graph.
Each linked pipeline or shader describes an _execution node_ within the
graph, which can: be dispatched dynamically from another shader within the
same graph.
This allows applications to describe much richer execution topologies at a
finer granularity than would typically be possible with API commands alone.

    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelines is a pointer to an array of slink:VkPipeline handles in

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this

    parameter to use as a pipeline to derive from

The parameters pname:basePipelineHandle and pname:basePipelineIndex are
described in more detail in <<pipelines-pipeline-derivatives,Pipeline
Derivatives>>.

Each shader stage provided when creating an execution graph pipeline
(including those in libraries) is associated with a name and an index,
determined by the inclusion or omission of a
slink:VkPipelineShaderStageNodeCreateInfoAMDX structure in its pname:pNext
chain.
For any graphics pipeline libraries, only the name and index of the vertex
or mesh shader stage is linked directly to the graph as a node - other
shader stages in the pipeline will be executed after those shader stages as
normal.
Task shaders cannot be included in a graphics pipeline used for a draw node.

In addition to the shader name and index, an internal "node index" is also
generated for each node, which can be queried with
flink:vkGetExecutionGraphPipelineNodeIndexAMDX, and is used exclusively for
initial dispatch of an execution graph.

ename:VK_SHADER_INDEX_UNUSED_AMDX is a special shader index used to indicate
that the created node does not override the index.
In this case, the shader index is determined through other means.
It is defined as:

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:pName is the shader name to use when creating a node in an
    execution graph.
    If pname:pName is `NULL`, the name of the entry point specified in
    SPIR-V is used as the shader name.
  * pname:index is the shader index to use when creating a node in an
    execution graph.
    If pname:index is ename:VK_SHADER_INDEX_UNUSED_AMDX then the original
    index is used, either as specified by the code:ShaderIndexAMDX execution
    mode, or `0` if that too is not specified.

When included in the pname:pNext chain of a
slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure, this structure specifies
the shader name and shader index of a node when creating an execution graph
pipeline.
If this structure is omitted, the shader name is set to the name of the
entry point in SPIR-V and the shader index is set to `0`.

When dispatching a node from another shader, the name is fixed at pipeline
creation, but the index can: be set dynamically.
By associating multiple shaders with the same name but different indexes,
applications can dynamically select different nodes to execute.
Applications must: ensure each node has a unique name and index.

== Dispatching a Graph

Initial dispatch of an execution graph is done from the host in the same way
as any other command, and can: be used in a similar way to compute dispatch
commands, with indirect variants available.

[open,refpage='vkCmdDispatchGraphAMDX',desc='Dispatch an execution graph',type='protos']
--
:refpage: vkCmdDispatchGraphAMDX

To record an execution graph dispatch, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdDispatchGraphAMDX.adoc[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:scratch is the address of scratch memory to be used.
  * pname:scratchSize is a range in bytes of scratch memory to be used.
  * pname:pCountInfo is a host pointer to a
    slink:VkDispatchGraphCountInfoAMDX structure defining the nodes which
    will be initially executed.

When this command is executed, the nodes specified in pname:pCountInfo are
executed.
Nodes executed as part of this command are not implicitly synchronized in
any way against each other once they are dispatched.
There are no rasterization order guarantees between separately dispatched
graphics nodes, though individual primitives within a single dispatch do
adhere to rasterization order.
Draw calls executed before or after the execution graph also execute relative to
each graphics node with respect to rasterization order.

For this command, all device/host pointers in substructures are treated as
host pointers and read only during host execution of this command.
Once this command returns, no reference to the original pointers is
retained.

Execution of this command may: modify any memory locations in the range
[pname:scratch,pname:scratch + pname:scratchSize).
Accesses to this memory range are performed in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_COMPUTE_SHADER_BIT pipeline stage with the

== Shader Enqueue

Compute shaders in an execution graph can: use the
code:OpInitializeNodePayloadsAMDX to initialize nodes for dispatch.
Any node payload initialized in this way will be enqueued for dispatch once
the shader is done writing to the payload.
As compilers may: be conservative when making this determination, shaders
can: further call code:OpFinalizeNodePayloadsAMDX to guarantee that the
payload is no longer being written.

The code:Node code:Name operand of the code:PayloadNodeNameAMDX decoration
on a payload identifies the shader name of the node to be enqueued, and the
code:Shader code:Index operand of code:OpInitializeNodePayloadsAMDX
identifies the shader index.
A node identified in this way is dispatched as described in the following
sections.


=== Compute Nodes

Compute shaders added as nodes to an execution graph are executed
differently based on the presence or absence of the
code:StaticNumWorkgroupsAMDX or code:CoalescingAMDX execution modes.

Dispatching a compute shader node that does not declare either the
code:StaticNumWorkgroupsAMDX or code:CoalescingAMDX execution mode will
execute a number of workgroups in each dimension specified by the first 12
bytes of the payload, interpreted as a slink:VkDispatchIndirectCommand.
The same payload will be broadcast to each workgroup in the same dispatch.
Additional values in the payload are have no effect on execution.

Dispatching a compute shader node with the code:StaticNumWorkgroupsAMDX
execution mode will execute workgroups in each dimension according to the
code:x, code:y, and code:z code:size operands to the
code:StaticNumWorkgroupsAMDX execution mode.
The same payload will be broadcast to each workgroup in the same dispatch.
Any values in the payload have no effect on execution.

Dispatching a compute shader node with the code:CoalescingAMDX execution
mode will enqueue a single invocation for execution.
Implementations may: combine multiple such dispatches into the same
workgroup, up to the size of the workgroup.
The number of invocations coalesced into a given workgroup in this way can:
be queried via the <<interfaces-builtin-variables-coalescedinputcountamd,
code:CoalescedInputCountAMDX>> built-in.
Any values in the payload have no effect on execution.

=== Mesh Nodes

Graphics pipelines added as nodes to an execution graph are executed in a
manner similar to a flink:vkCmdDrawMeshTasksIndirectEXT, using the same
payloads as compute shaders, but capturing some state from the command buffer.

[[executiongraphs-meshnodes-statecapture]]
When an execution graph dispatch is recorded into a command buffer, it
captures the following dynamic state for use with draw nodes:

  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS`
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state[]
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_WITH_COUNT`
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR_WITH_COUNT`
endif::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state[]
ifdef::VK_EXT_sampler_locations[]
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_EXT`
endif::VK_EXT_sampler_locations[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
  * `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_KHR`
endif::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]

Other state is not captured, and graphics pipelines must: not be created
with other dynamic states when used as a library in an execution graph
pipeline.
