To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a macOS code:NSView, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateMacOSSurfaceMVK.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance with which to associate the surface.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkMacOSSurfaceCreateInfoMVK structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a slink:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The slink:VkMacOSSurfaceCreateInfoMVK structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkMacOSSurfaceCreateInfoMVK.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:pView is a reference to a code:NSView object which will display
    this surface.
    This code:NSView must: be backed by a code:CALayer instance of type
    code:CAMetalLayer.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkMacOSSurfaceCreateInfoMVK-pView-01317]]
    pname:pView must: be a valid code:NSView and must: be backed by a
    code:CALayer instance of type code:CAMetalLayer.
