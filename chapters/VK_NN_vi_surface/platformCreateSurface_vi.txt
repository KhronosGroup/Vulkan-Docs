To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for an code:nn::code:vi::code:Layer,
query the layer's native handle using
code:nn::code:vi::code:GetNativeWindow, and then call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateViSurfaceNN.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance with which to associate the surface.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkViSurfaceCreateInfoNN structure containing parameters affecting
    the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a slink:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

During the lifetime of a surface created using a particular
code:nn::code:vi::code:NativeWindowHandle any attempts to create another
surface for the same code:nn::code:vi::code:Layer and any attempts to
connect to the same code:nn::code:vi::code:Layer through other platform
mechanisms will have undefined results.

The pname:currentExtent of a VI surface is always undefined.
Applications are expected to choose an appropriate size for the swapchain's
pname:imageExtent (e.g., by matching the result of a call to
code:nn::code:vi::code:GetDisplayResolution).

The sname:VkViSurfaceCreateInfoNN structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkViSurfaceCreateInfoNN.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:window is the code:nn::code:vi::code:NativeWindowHandle for the
    code:nn::code:vi::code:Layer with which to associate the surface.

    pname:window must: be a valid code:nn::code:vi::code:NativeWindowHandle
