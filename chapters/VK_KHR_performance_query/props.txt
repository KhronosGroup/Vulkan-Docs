The sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR
structure describe the following implementation-dependent properties:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:allowCommandBufferQueryCopies is ename:VK_TRUE if the performance
    query pools are allowed to be used with flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR.txt[]

If the sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR structure is
included in the pname:pNext chain of slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2, it
is filled with the implementation-dependent properties.
