The sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR
structure describe the following implementation-dependent features:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:performanceCounterQueryPools is ename:VK_TRUE if the physical
    device supports performance counter query pools.
  * pname:performanceCounterMultipleQueryPools is ename:VK_TRUE` if the
    physical device supports using multiple performance query pools in a
    primary command buffer and secondary command buffers executed within it.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR.txt[]

To query supported performance counter query pool features, call
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 with a
sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR structure included in the
pname:pNext chain of its pname:pFeatures parameter.
The sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR structure can: also be
included in the pname:pNext chain of a slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure,
in which case it controls which additional features are enabled in the
device.

The sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR
structure describe the following implementation-dependent properties:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:allowCommandBufferQueryCopies is ename:VK_TRUE if the performance
    query pools are allowed to be used with flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR.txt[]

If the sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryPropertiesKHR structure is
included in the pname:pNext chain of slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2, it
is filled with the implementation-dependent properties.
