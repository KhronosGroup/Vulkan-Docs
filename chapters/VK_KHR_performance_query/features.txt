To query supported performance counter query pool features, call
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 with a
sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR structure included in the
pname:pNext chain of its pname:pFeatures parameter.

The sname:VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
// tag::VK_KHR_performance_query-features[]
  * [[features-performanceCounterQueryPools]]
    pname:performanceCounterQueryPools indicates whether the implementation
    supports performance counter query pools.
  * [[features-performanceCounterMultipleQueryPools]]
    pname:performanceCounterMultipleQueryPools indicates whether the
    implementation supports using multiple performance query pools in a
    primary command buffer and secondary command buffers executed within it.
