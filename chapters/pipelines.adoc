= Pipelines

The following <<pipelines-block-diagram,figure>> shows a block diagram of
the Vulkan pipelines.
Some Vulkan commands specify geometric objects to be drawn or computational
work to be performed, while others specify state controlling how objects are
handled by the various pipeline stages, or control data transfer between
memory organized as images and buffers.
Commands are effectively sent through a processing pipeline, either a
_graphics pipeline_,
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing,VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline[]
a _ray tracing pipeline_,
endif::VK_NV_ray_tracing,VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline[]
or a _compute pipeline_.

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]
The graphics pipeline can be operated in two modes, as either _primitive
shading_ or _mesh shading_ pipeline.

*Primitive Shading*

endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]

The first stage of the <<pipelines-graphics,graphics pipeline>>
(<<drawing,Input Assembler>>) assembles vertices to form geometric
primitives such as points, lines, and triangles, based on a requested
primitive topology.
In the next stage (<<shaders-vertex,Vertex Shader>>) vertices can: be
transformed, computing positions and attributes for each vertex.
If <<tessellation,tessellation>> and/or <<geometry,geometry>> shaders are
supported, they can: then generate multiple primitives from a single input
primitive, possibly changing the primitive topology or generating additional
attribute data in the process.

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]
*Mesh Shading*

When using the <<mesh,_mesh shading_>> pipeline input primitives are not
assembled implicitly, but explicitly through the (<<shaders-mesh,Mesh
Shader>>).
The work on the mesh pipeline is initiated by the application
<<drawing-mesh-shading,drawing>> a set of mesh tasks.

If an optional (<<shaders-task,Task Shader>>) is active, each task triggers
the execution of a task shader workgroup that will generate a new set of
tasks upon completion.
Each of these spawned tasks, or each of the original dispatched tasks if no
task shader is present, triggers the execution of a mesh shader workgroup
that produces an output mesh with a variable-sized number of primitives
assembled from vertices stored in the output mesh.

*Common*
endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]

The final resulting primitives are <<vertexpostproc-clipping,clipped>> to a
clip volume in preparation for the next stage, <<primsrast,Rasterization>>.
The rasterizer produces a series of _fragments_ associated with a region of
the framebuffer, from a two-dimensional description of a point, line
segment, or triangle.
These fragments are processed by <<fragops,fragment operations>> to
determine whether generated values will be written to the framebuffer.
<<fragops-shader, Fragment shading>> determines the values to be written to
the framebuffer attachments.
Framebuffer operations then read and write the color and depth/stencil
attachments of the framebuffer for a given subpass of a <<renderpass,render
pass instance>>.
The attachments can: be used as input attachments in the fragment shader in
a later subpass of the same render pass.

The <<pipelines-compute,compute pipeline>> is a separate pipeline from the
graphics pipeline, which operates on one-, two-, or three-dimensional
workgroups which can: read from and write to buffer and image memory.

This ordering is meant only as a tool for describing Vulkan, not as a strict
rule of how Vulkan is implemented, and we present it only as a means to
organize the various operations of the pipelines.
Actual ordering guarantees between pipeline stages are explained in detail
in the <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, synchronization chapter>>.

Each pipeline is controlled by a monolithic object created from a
description of all of the shader stages and any relevant fixed-function
stages.
<<interfaces,Linking>> the whole pipeline together allows the optimization
of shaders based on their input/outputs and eliminates expensive draw time
state validation.

A pipeline object is bound to the current state using
flink:vkCmdBindPipeline.
Any pipeline object state that is specified as <<pipelines-dynamic-state,
dynamic>> is not applied to the current state when the pipeline object is
bound, but is instead set by dynamic state setting commands.

No state, including dynamic state, is inherited from one command buffer to
another.

== Compute Pipelines

Compute pipelines consist of a single static compute shader stage and the
pipeline layout.

The compute pipeline represents a compute shader and is created by calling
fname:vkCreateComputePipelines with pname:module and pname:pName selecting
an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point defines a valid
compute shader, in the slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure
contained within the slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structure.

[open,refpage='vkCreateComputePipelines',desc='Creates a new compute pipeline object',type='protos']

To create compute pipelines, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateComputePipelines.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the compute pipelines.
  * pname:pipelineCache is either dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, indicating that
    pipeline caching is disabled; or the handle of a valid
    <<pipelines-cache,pipeline cache>> object, in which case use of that
    cache is enabled for the duration of the command.
  * pname:createInfoCount is the length of the pname:pCreateInfos and
    pname:pPipelines arrays.
  * pname:pCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structures.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelines is a pointer to an array of slink:VkPipeline handles in
    which the resulting compute pipeline objects are returned.

ifdef::VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier[]
If the <<features-shaderModuleIdentifier, pname:shaderModuleIdentifier>>
feature is enabled, applications can: omit shader code for pname:stage and
instead provide a module identifier.
This is done by including a
slink:VkPipelineShaderStageModuleIdentifierCreateInfoEXT struct with
pname:identifierSize not equal to 0 in the pname:pNext chain.
A shader stage created in this way is equivalent to one created using a
shader module with the same identifier.
The identifier allows an implementation to look up a pipeline without
consuming a valid SPIR-V module.
If a pipeline is not found, pipeline compilation is not possible and the
implementation must: fail as specified by
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_FAIL_ON_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED_BIT.

When an identifier is used in lieu of a shader module, implementations may:
fail pipeline compilation with ename:VK_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED for any
reason.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The rationale for the relaxed requirement on implementations to return a
pipeline with slink:VkPipelineShaderStageModuleIdentifierCreateInfoEXT is
that layers or tools may intercept pipeline creation calls and require the
full SPIR-V context to operate correctly.
ICDs are not expected to fail pipeline compilation if the pipeline exists in
a cache somewhere.
====

ifdef::VK_KHR_pipeline_library[]
Applications can: use identifiers when creating pipelines with
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LIBRARY_BIT_KHR.
When creating such pipelines, ename:VK_SUCCESS may: be returned, but
subsequently fail when referencing the pipeline in a
slink:VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR struct.
Applications must: allow pipeline compilation to fail during link steps with
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_FAIL_ON_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED_BIT as it may:
not be possible to determine if a pipeline can: be created from identifiers
until the link step.

When a pipeline is created without a slink:VkRenderPass, if this structure
is present in the pname:pNext chain of slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo,
it specifies the view mask and format of attachments used for rendering.
If this structure is not specified, and the pipeline does not include a
slink:VkRenderPass, pname:viewMask and pname:colorAttachmentCount are `0`,
and pname:depthAttachmentFormat and pname:stencilAttachmentFormat are
ename:VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED.
If a graphics pipeline is created with a valid slink:VkRenderPass,
parameters of this structure are ignored.

If pname:depthAttachmentFormat, pname:stencilAttachmentFormat, or any
element of pname:pColorAttachmentFormats is ename:VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED, it
indicates that the corresponding attachment is unused within the render
pass.
Valid formats indicate that an attachment can: be used - but it is still
valid to set the attachment to `NULL` when beginning rendering.

ifdef::VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library[]
When an implementation is looking up a pipeline in a

linked libraries, implementations should: always return an equivalent
pipeline created with
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT if available,
whether or not that bit was specified.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Using ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT (or not) when
linking pipeline libraries is intended as a performance tradeoff between
host and device.
If the bit is omitted, linking should be faster and produce a pipeline more
rapidly, but performance of the pipeline on the target device may be
reduced.
If the bit is included, linking may be slower but should produce a pipeline
with device performance comparable to a monolithically created pipeline.
Using both options can allow latency-sensitive applications to generate a
suboptimal but usable pipeline quickly, and then perform an optimal link in
the background, substituting the result for the suboptimally linked pipeline
as soon as it is available.

=== Valid Combinations of Stages for Graphics Pipelines

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]
Primitive processing can be handled either on a per primitive basis by the
vertex, tessellation, and geometry shader stages, or on a per mesh basis
using task and mesh shader stages.
If the pipeline includes a mesh shader stage, it uses the mesh pipeline,
otherwise it uses the primitive pipeline.

If a task shader is omitted, the task shading stage is skipped.
endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]

If tessellation shader stages are omitted, the tessellation shading and
fixed-function stages of the pipeline are skipped.

If a geometry shader is omitted, the geometry shading stage is skipped.

If a fragment shader is omitted, fragment color outputs have undefined:
values, and the fragment depth value is determined by <<fragops, Fragment
Operations>> state.
This can: be useful for depth-only rendering.

Presence of a shader stage in a pipeline is indicated by including a valid
slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo with pname:module and pname:pName
selecting an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point is
valid for the stage specified by pname:stage.

Presence of some of the fixed-function stages in the pipeline is implicitly
derived from enabled shaders and provided state.
For example, the fixed-function tessellator is always present when the
pipeline has valid Tessellation Control and Tessellation Evaluation shaders.

  * Depth/stencil-only rendering in a subpass with no color attachments
  ** Active Pipeline Shader Stages
  *** Vertex Shader
  ** Required: Fixed-Function Pipeline Stages

=== Graphics Pipeline Shader Groups

Graphics pipelines can contain multiple shader groups that can be bound
individually.
Each shader group behaves as if it was a pipeline using the shader group's
state.
When the pipeline is bound by regular means, it behaves as if the state of
group `0` is active, use flink:vkCmdBindPipelineShaderGroupNV to bind an
individual shader group.

The primary purpose of shader groups is allowing the device to bind
different pipeline state using <<device-generated-commands>>.

The sname:VkGraphicsPipelineShaderGroupsCreateInfoNV structure is defined

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:groupCount is the number of elements in the pname:pGroups array.
  * pname:pGroups is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkGraphicsShaderGroupCreateInfoNV structures specifying which
    state of the original slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo each shader
    group overrides.
  * pname:pipelineCount is the number of elements in the pname:pPipelines
    array.
  * pname:pPipelines is a pointer to an array of graphics sname:VkPipeline
    structures which are referenced within the created pipeline, including
    all their shader groups.

When referencing shader groups by index, groups defined in the referenced
pipelines are treated as if they were defined as additional entries in
pname:pGroups.
They are appended in the order they appear in the pname:pPipelines array and
in the pname:pGroups array when those pipelines were defined.

ifdef::VK_KHR_pipeline_library[]

defines a _pipeline library_ which cannot: be bound as a ray tracing
pipeline directly.
Instead, pipeline libraries define common shaders and shader groups which
can: be included in future pipeline creation.

If pipeline libraries are included in pname:pLibraryInfo, shaders defined in
those libraries are treated as if they were defined as additional entries in
pname:pStages, appended in the order they appear in the pname:pLibraries
array and in the pname:pStages array when those libraries were defined.

When referencing shader groups in order to obtain a shader group handle,
groups defined in those libraries are treated as if they were defined as
additional entries in pname:pGroups, appended in the order they appear in
the pname:pLibraries array and in the pname:pGroups array when those
libraries were defined.
The shaders these groups reference are set when the pipeline library is
created, referencing those specified in the pipeline library, not in the
pipeline that includes it.

The default stack size for a pipeline if
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_STACK_SIZE_KHR is not provided

pname:maxPipelineRayHitAttributeSize is calculated as the maximum number of

[[pipelines-multiple]]
== Multiple Pipeline Creation

slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo,
ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline[slink:VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[slink:VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoNV,]
or slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structures into the

ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesNV,]
and flink:vkCreateComputePipelines commands, respectively.
Applications can: group together similar pipelines to be created in a single
call, and implementations are encouraged to look for reuse opportunities
within a group-create.

When an application attempts to create many pipelines in a single command,
it is possible that some subset may: fail creation.
In that case, the corresponding entries in the pname:pPipelines output array
will be filled with dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values.
If any pipeline fails creation despite valid arguments (for example, due to
out of memory errors), the elink:VkResult code returned by
ftext:vkCreate*Pipelines will indicate why.
The implementation will attempt to create all pipelines, and only return
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values for those that actually failed.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_EXT_pipeline_creation_cache_control[]
If creation fails for a pipeline that had
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_EARLY_RETURN_ON_FAILURE_BIT set, pipelines at an
index in the pname:pPipelines array greater than or equal to that of the
failing pipeline must: be set to dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_EXT_pipeline_creation_cache_control[]

If multiple pipelines fail to be created, the elink:VkResult must: be the
return value of any of the pipelines which did not return ename:VK_SUCCESS.


[[pipelines-pipeline-derivatives]]
== Pipeline Derivatives

A pipeline derivative is a child pipeline created from a parent pipeline,
where the child and parent are expected to have much commonality.
The goal of derivative pipelines is that they be cheaper to create using the
parent as a starting point, and that it be more efficient (on either host or
device) to switch/bind between children of the same parent.

A derivative pipeline is created by setting the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag in the
stext:Vk*PipelineCreateInfo structure.
If this is set, then exactly one of pname:basePipelineHandle or
pname:basePipelineIndex members of the structure must: have a valid
handle/index, and specifies the parent pipeline.
If pname:basePipelineHandle is used, the parent pipeline must: have already
been created.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, then the parent is being created in the
same command.
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE acts as the invalid handle for
pname:basePipelineHandle, and -1 is the invalid index for
pname:basePipelineIndex.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, the base pipeline must: appear earlier
in the array.
The base pipeline must: have been created with the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT flag set.


[[pipelines-cache]]
== Pipeline Cache

[open,refpage='VkPipelineCache',desc='Opaque handle to a pipeline cache object',type='handles']
--
Pipeline cache objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be
reused between pipelines and between runs of an application.
Reuse between pipelines is achieved by passing the same pipeline cache
object when creating multiple related pipelines.
Reuse across runs of an application is achieved by retrieving pipeline cache
contents in one run of an application, saving the contents, and using them
to preinitialize a pipeline cache on a subsequent run.
The contents of the pipeline cache objects are managed by the
implementation.
Applications can: manage the host memory consumed by a pipeline cache object
and control the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache object.

Pipeline cache objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineCache handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkPipelineCache.adoc[]

=== Creating a Pipeline Cache

To create pipeline cache objects, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreatePipelineCache.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the pipeline cache
    object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo
    structure containing initial parameters for the pipeline cache object.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelineCache is a pointer to a slink:VkPipelineCache handle in
    which the resulting pipeline cache object is returned.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Applications can: track and manage the total host memory size of a pipeline
cache object using the pname:pAllocator.
Applications can: limit the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache
object in fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData.
Implementations should: not internally limit the total number of entries
added to a pipeline cache object or the total host memory consumed.
====

Once created, a pipeline cache can: be passed to the
flink:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines
ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesNV,]
and flink:vkCreateComputePipelines commands.
If the pipeline cache passed into these commands is not
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, the implementation will query it for possible reuse
opportunities and update it with new content.
The use of the pipeline cache object in these commands is internally
synchronized, and the same pipeline cache object can: be used in multiple
threads simultaneously.

Data can: be retrieved from a pipeline cache object using the command:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetPipelineCacheData.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the pipeline cache.
  * pname:pipelineCache is the pipeline cache to retrieve data from.
  * pname:pDataSize is a pointer to a code:size_t value related to the
    amount of data in the pipeline cache, as described below.
  * pname:pData is either `NULL` or a pointer to a buffer.

If pname:pData is `NULL`, then the maximum size of the data that can: be
retrieved from the pipeline cache, in bytes, is returned in pname:pDataSize.
Otherwise, pname:pDataSize must: point to a variable set by the user to the
size of the buffer, in bytes, pointed to by pname:pData, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the amount of data actually written to
pname:pData.
If pname:pDataSize is less than the maximum size that can: be retrieved by
the pipeline cache, at most pname:pDataSize bytes will be written to
pname:pData, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of
ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all of the pipeline cache was
returned.

Any data written to pname:pData is valid and can: be provided as the
pname:pInitialData member of the slink:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo structure
passed to fname:vkCreatePipelineCache.

Two calls to fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData with the same parameters must:
retrieve the same data unless a command that modifies the contents of the
cache is called between them.

The initial bytes written to pname:pData must: be a header as described in
the <<pipelines-cache-header, Pipeline Cache Header>> section.

[[pipelines-cache-header]]
=== Pipeline Cache Header

Applications can: store the data retrieved from the pipeline cache, and use
these data, possibly in a future run of the application, to populate new
pipeline cache objects.
The results of pipeline compiles, however, may: depend on the vendor ID,
device ID, driver version, and other details of the device.
To enable applications to detect when previously retrieved data is
incompatible with the device, the pipeline cache data must: begin with a
valid pipeline cache header.

[open,refpage='VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersionOne',desc='Structure describing the layout of the pipeline cache header',type='structs']

Version one of the pipeline cache header is defined as:

  * pname:headerSize is the length in bytes of the pipeline cache header.
  * pname:headerVersion is a elink:VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersion enum value
    specifying the version of the header.
    A consumer of the pipeline cache should: use the cache version to
    interpret the remainder of the cache header.
  * pname:vendorID is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:vendorID
    of the implementation.
  * pname:deviceID is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:deviceID
    of the implementation.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:pipelineCacheUUID of the
    implementation.

Unlike most structures declared by the Vulkan API, all fields of this
structure are written with the least significant byte first, regardless of
host byte-order.

The C language specification does not define the packing of structure
members.
This layout assumes tight structure member packing, with members laid out in
the order listed in the structure, and the intended size of the structure is
32 bytes.
If a compiler produces code that diverges from that pattern, applications
must: employ another method to set values at the correct offsets.

[[pipelines-specialization-constants]]
== Specialization Constants

Specialization constants are a mechanism whereby constants in a SPIR-V
module can: have their constant value specified at the time the
sname:VkPipeline is created.
This allows a SPIR-V module to have constants that can: be modified while
executing an application that uses the Vulkan API.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Specialization constants are useful to allow a compute shader to have its
local workgroup size changed at runtime by the user, for example.
====

Each slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure contains a
pname:pSpecializationInfo member, which can: be `NULL` to indicate no
specialization constants, or point to a sname:VkSpecializationInfo
structure.

[open,refpage='VkSpecializationInfo',desc='Structure specifying specialization information',type='structs']
--
The sname:VkSpecializationInfo structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSpecializationInfo.adoc[]

  * pname:mapEntryCount is the number of entries in the pname:pMapEntries
    array.
  * pname:pMapEntries is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry structures, which map constant IDs to
    offsets in pname:pData.
  * pname:dataSize is the byte size of the pname:pData buffer.
  * pname:pData contains the actual constant values to specialize with.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkSpecializationInfo-offset-00773]]

    than or equal to pname:dataSize minus pname:offset
  * [[VUID-VkSpecializationInfo-constantID-04911]]
    The pname:constantID value of each element of pname:pMapEntries must: be
    unique within pname:pMapEntries
****

include::{generated}/validity/structs/VkSpecializationInfo.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='VkSpecializationMapEntry',desc='Structure specifying a specialization map entry',type='structs']
--
The sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSpecializationMapEntry.adoc[]

  * pname:constantID is the ID of the specialization constant in SPIR-V.
  * pname:offset is the byte offset of the specialization constant value
    within the supplied data buffer.
  * pname:size is the byte size of the specialization constant value within
    the supplied data buffer.

If a pname:constantID value is not a specialization constant ID used in the
shader, that map entry does not affect the behavior of the pipeline.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkSpecializationMapEntry-constantID-00776]]
    For a pname:constantID specialization constant declared in a shader,
    pname:size must: match the byte size of the pname:constantID.

****

include::{generated}/validity/structs/VkSpecializationMapEntry.adoc[]

In human readable SPIR-V:

[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
OpDecorate %x SpecId 13 ; decorate .x component of WorkgroupSize with ID 13
OpDecorate %y SpecId 42 ; decorate .y component of WorkgroupSize with ID 42
OpDecorate %z SpecId 3  ; decorate .z component of WorkgroupSize with ID 3
OpDecorate %wgsize BuiltIn WorkgroupSize ; decorate WorkgroupSize onto constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 0 ; declare an unsigned 32-bit type
%uvec3 = OpTypeVector %i32 3 ; declare a 3 element vector type of unsigned 32-bit
%x = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .x component of WorkgroupSize
%y = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .y component of WorkgroupSize
%z = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .z component of WorkgroupSize
%wgsize = OpSpecConstantComposite %uvec3 %x %y %z ; declare WorkgroupSize
---------------------------------------------------

From the above we have three specialization constants, one for each of the
x, y & z elements of the WorkgroupSize vector.

Now to specialize the above via the specialization constants mechanism:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
const VkSpecializationMapEntry entries[] =
{
    {
        13,                             // constantID
        0 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    },
    {
        42,                             // constantID
        1 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    },
    {
        3,                              // constantID
        2 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    }
};

const uint32_t data[] = { 16, 8, 4 }; // our workgroup size is 16x8x4

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    3,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    3 * sizeof(uint32_t),               // dataSize
    data,                               // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

Then when calling flink:vkCreateComputePipelines, and passing the
sname:VkSpecializationInfo we defined as the pname:pSpecializationInfo
parameter of slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo, we will create a compute
pipeline with the runtime specified local workgroup size.

Another example would be that an application has a SPIR-V module that has
some platform-dependent constants they wish to use.

In human readable SPIR-V:

// [source,glsl]
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
OpDecorate %1 SpecId 0  ; decorate our signed 32-bit integer constant
OpDecorate %2 SpecId 12 ; decorate our 32-bit floating-point constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 1   ; declare a signed 32-bit type
%float = OpTypeFloat 32 ; declare a 32-bit floating-point type
%1 = OpSpecConstant %i32 -1 ; some signed 32-bit integer constant
%2 = OpSpecConstant %float 0.5 ; some 32-bit floating-point constant
---------------------------------------------------

From the above we have two specialization constants, one is a signed 32-bit
integer and the second is a 32-bit floating-point value.

Now to specialize the above via the specialization constants mechanism:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
struct SpecializationData {
    int32_t data0;
    float data1;
};

const VkSpecializationMapEntry entries[] =
{
    {
        0,                                    // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data0),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data0)     // size
    },
    {
        12,                                   // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data1),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data1)     // size
    }
};

SpecializationData data;
data.data0 = -42;    // set the data for the 32-bit integer
data.data1 = 42.0f;  // set the data for the 32-bit floating-point

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    2,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    sizeof(data),                       // dataSize
    &data,                              // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

It is legal for a SPIR-V module with specializations to be compiled into a
pipeline where no specialization information was provided.
SPIR-V specialization constants contain default values such that if a
specialization is not provided, the default value will be used.
In the examples above, it would be valid for an application to only
specialize some of the specialization constants within the SPIR-V module,
and let the other constants use their default values encoded within the
OpSpecConstant declarations.

[[pipelines-dynamic-state]]
== Dynamic State

When a pipeline object is bound, any pipeline object state that is not
specified as dynamic is applied to the command buffer state.
Pipeline object state that is specified as dynamic is not applied to the
command buffer state at this time.
Instead, dynamic state can: be modified at any time and persists for the
lifetime of the command buffer, or until modified by another dynamic state
setting command, or made invalid by another pipeline bind with that state
specified as static.

When a pipeline object is bound, the following applies to each state
parameter:

  * If the state is not specified as dynamic in the new pipeline object,
    then that command buffer state is overwritten by the state in the new
    pipeline object.
    Before any draw or dispatch call with this pipeline there must: not have
    been any calls to any of the corresponding dynamic state setting
    commands after this pipeline was bound.
  * If the state is specified as dynamic in the new pipeline object, then
    that command buffer state is not disturbed.
    Before any draw or dispatch call with this pipeline there must: have
    been at least one call to each of the corresponding dynamic state
    setting commands.
    The state-setting commands must: be recorded after command buffer
    recording was begun, or after the last command binding a pipeline object
    with that state specified as static, whichever was the latter.
  * If the state is not included (corresponding pointer in
    slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo was `NULL` or was ignored) in the new
    pipeline object, then that command buffer state is not disturbed.
ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]
    For example, mesh shading pipelines do not include vertex input state
    and therefore do not disturb any such command buffer state.
endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader,VK_EXT_mesh_shader[]

Dynamic state that does not affect the result of operations can: be left
undefined:.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For example, if blending is disabled by the pipeline object state then the
dynamic color blend constants do not need to be specified in the command
buffer, even if this state is specified as dynamic in the pipeline object.

When a pipeline is created, its state and shaders are compiled into zero or

against that pipeline.
To query the properties of these pipeline executables, call:

  * pname:device is the device that created the pipeline.
  * pname:pPipelineInfo describes the pipeline being queried.
  * pname:pExecutableCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number
    of pipeline executables available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR structures.

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of pipeline executables
associated with the pipeline is returned in pname:pExecutableCount.
Otherwise, pname:pExecutableCount must: point to a variable set by the user
to the number of elements in the pname:pProperties array, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pProperties.
If pname:pExecutableCount is less than the number of pipeline executables
associated with the pipeline, at most pname:pExecutableCount structures will
be written, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of
