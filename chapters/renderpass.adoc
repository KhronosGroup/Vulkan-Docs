[NOTE]
.Note
====
For more complex rendering graphs, it is possible to pre-define a static
_render pass_ object, which as well as allowing draw commands, allows the
definition of framebuffer-local dependencies between multiple subpasses.
These objects have a lot of setup cost compared to
flink:vkCmdBeginRendering, but use of subpass dependencies can confer
important performance benefits on some devices.

A render pass object represents a collection of attachments, subpasses, and
dependencies between the subpasses, and describes how the attachments are
used over the course of the subpasses.

Render passes are represented by sname:VkRenderPass handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkRenderPass.adoc[]
--

An _attachment description_ describes the properties of an attachment
including its format, sample count, and how its contents are treated at the
beginning and end of each render pass instance.

[[renderpass-subpass]]
A _subpass_ represents a phase of rendering that reads and writes a subset
of the attachments in a render pass.
Rendering commands are recorded into a particular subpass of a render pass
instance.

A _subpass description_ describes the subset of attachments that is involved
in the execution of a subpass.
Each subpass can: read from some attachments as _input attachments_, write
to some as _color attachments_ or _depth/stencil attachments_,
ifdef::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]
perform _shader resolve operations_ to _color_attachments_ or
_depth/stencil_attachments_,
endif::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]
and perform _multisample resolve operations_ to _resolve attachments_.
A subpass description can: also include a set of _preserve attachments_,
which are attachments that are not read or written by the subpass but whose
contents must: be preserved throughout the subpass.

A subpass _uses an attachment_ if the attachment is a color, depth/stencil,
resolve,
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
depth/stencil resolve,
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
fragment shading rate,
endif::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
or input attachment for that subpass (as determined by the
pname:pColorAttachments, pname:pDepthStencilAttachment,
pname:pResolveAttachments,
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
slink:VkSubpassDescriptionDepthStencilResolve::pname:pDepthStencilResolveAttachment,
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
slink:VkFragmentShadingRateAttachmentInfoKHR::pname:pFragmentShadingRateAttachment->attachment,
endif::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
and pname:pInputAttachments members of slink:VkSubpassDescription,
respectively).
A subpass does not use an attachment if that attachment is preserved by the
subpass.
The _first use of an attachment_ is in the lowest numbered subpass that uses
that attachment.
Similarly, the _last use of an attachment_ is in the highest numbered
subpass that uses that attachment.

The subpasses in a render pass all render to the same dimensions, and
fragments for pixel (x,y,layer) in one subpass can: only read attachment
contents written by previous subpasses at that same (x,y,layer) location.
ifdef::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate,VK_NV_shading_rate,VK_EXT_fragment_density_map[]
For multi-pixel fragments, the pixel read from an input attachment is
selected from the pixels covered by that fragment in an
implementation-dependent manner.
However, this selection must: be made consistently for any fragment with the
same shading rate for the lifetime of the slink:VkDevice.
endif::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate,VK_NV_shading_rate,VK_EXT_fragment_density_map[]

[NOTE]
.Note
====
By describing a complete set of subpasses in advance, render passes provide
the implementation an opportunity to optimize the storage and transfer of
attachment data between subpasses.

In practice, this means that subpasses with a simple framebuffer-space
dependency may: be merged into a single tiled rendering pass, keeping the
attachment data on-chip for the duration of a render pass instance.
However, it is also quite common for a render pass to only contain a single
subpass.
====

_Subpass dependencies_ describe <<synchronization-dependencies, execution
and memory dependencies>> between subpasses.

A _subpass dependency chain_ is a sequence of subpass dependencies in a
render pass, where the source subpass of each subpass dependency (after the
first) equals the destination subpass of the previous dependency.

Execution of subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to
other subpasses, unless otherwise enforced by an execution dependency.
Each subpass only respects <<synchronization-submission-order, submission
order>> for commands recorded in the same subpass, and the
flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass and flink:vkCmdEndRenderPass commands that
delimit the render pass - commands within other subpasses are not included.
This affects most other <<synchronization-implicit, implicit ordering
guarantees>>.

A render pass describes the structure of subpasses and attachments
independent of any specific image views for the attachments.
The specific image views that will be used for the attachments, and their
dimensions, are specified in sname:VkFramebuffer objects.
Framebuffers are created with respect to a specific render pass that the
framebuffer is compatible with (see <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass
Compatibility>>).
Collectively, a render pass and a framebuffer define the complete render
target state for one or more subpasses as well as the algorithmic
dependencies between the subpasses.

The various pipeline stages of the drawing commands for a given subpass may:
execute concurrently and/or out of order, both within and across drawing
commands, whilst still respecting <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order,
pipeline order>>.
However for a given (x,y,layer,sample) sample location, certain per-sample
operations are performed in <<primsrast-order,rasterization order>>.

When a subpass uses a non-zero view mask, _multiview_ functionality is
considered to be enabled.
Multiview is all-or-nothing for a render pass - that is, either all
subpasses must: have a non-zero view mask (though some subpasses may: have
only one view) or all must: be zero.
Multiview causes all drawing and clear commands in the subpass to behave as
if they were broadcast to each view, where a view is represented by one
layer of the framebuffer attachments.
All draws and clears are broadcast to each _view index_ whose bit is set in
the view mask.
The view index is provided in the code:ViewIndex shader input variable, and
color, depth/stencil, and input attachments all read/write the layer of the
framebuffer corresponding to the view index.

If the view mask is zero for all subpasses, multiview is considered to be
disabled and all drawing commands execute normally, without this additional
broadcasting.

Some implementations may: not support multiview in conjunction with
ifdef::VK_EXT_mesh_shader[<<features-multiview-mesh, mesh shaders>>,]
<<features-multiview-gs, geometry shaders>> or <<features-multiview-tess,
tessellation shaders>>.

[[renderpass-multiview-view-local]]
When multiview is enabled, the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT bit in a
dependency can: be used to express a view-local dependency, meaning that
each view in the destination subpass depends on a single view in the source
subpass.
Unlike pipeline barriers, a subpass dependency can: potentially have a
different view mask in the source subpass and the destination subpass.
If the dependency is view-local, then each view ([eq]#dstView#) in the
destination subpass depends on the view [eq]#dstView {plus}
pname:pViewOffsets[dependency]# in the source subpass.
If there is not such a view in the source subpass, then this dependency does
not affect that view in the destination subpass.
If the dependency is not view-local, then all views in the destination
subpass depend on all views in the source subpass, and the view offset is
ignored.
A non-zero view offset is not allowed in a self-dependency.

The elements of pname:pCorrelationMasks are a set of masks of views
indicating that views in the same mask may: exhibit spatial coherency
between the views, making it more efficient to render them concurrently.
Correlation masks must: not have a functional effect on the results of the
multiview rendering.

When multiview is enabled, at the beginning of each subpass all non-render
pass state is undefined:.
In particular, each time flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass or
flink:vkCmdNextSubpass is called the graphics pipeline must: be bound, any
relevant descriptor sets or vertex/index buffers must: be bound, and any
relevant dynamic state or push constants must: be set before they are used.

ifdef::VK_NVX_multiview_per_view_attributes[]

A multiview subpass can: declare that its shaders will write per-view
attributes for all views in a single invocation, by setting the
ename:VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX bit in the subpass
description.
The only supported per-view attributes are position and viewport mask, and
per-view position and viewport masks are written to output array variables
decorated with code:PositionPerViewNV and code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV,
respectively.
If `apiext:VK_NV_viewport_array2` is not supported and enabled,
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV must: not be used.
Values written to elements of code:PositionPerViewNV and
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV must: not depend on the code:ViewIndex.
The shader must: also write to an output variable decorated with
code:Position, and the value written to code:Position must: equal the value
written to code:PositionPerViewNV[code:ViewIndex].
Similarly, if code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV is written to then the shader must:
also write to an output variable decorated with code:ViewportMaskNV, and the
value written to code:ViewportMaskNV must: equal the value written to
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV[code:ViewIndex].
Implementations will either use values taken from code:Position and
code:ViewportMaskNV and invoke the shader once for each view, or will use
values taken from code:PositionPerViewNV and code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV and
invoke the shader fewer times.
The values written to code:Position and code:ViewportMaskNV must: not depend
on the values written to code:PositionPerViewNV and
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV, or vice versa (to allow compilers to eliminate
the unused outputs).
All attributes that do not have `*PerViewNV` counterparts must: not depend
on code:ViewIndex.

Per-view attributes are all-or-nothing for a subpass.
That is, all pipelines compiled against a subpass that includes the
ename:VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX bit must: write
per-view attributes to the `*PerViewNV[]` shader outputs, in addition to the
non-per-view (e.g. code:Position) outputs.
Pipelines compiled against a subpass that does not include this bit must:
not include the `*PerViewNV[]` outputs in their interfaces.

The sname:VkAttachmentDescription structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkAttachmentDescription.adoc[]

  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkAttachmentDescriptionFlagBits
    specifying additional properties of the attachment.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat value specifying the format of the
    image view that will be used for the attachment.
  * pname:samples is a elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits value specifying the
    number of samples of the image.
  * pname:loadOp is a elink:VkAttachmentLoadOp value specifying how the
    contents of color and depth components of the attachment are treated at
    the beginning of the subpass where it is first used.
  * pname:storeOp is a elink:VkAttachmentStoreOp value specifying how the
    contents of color and depth components of the attachment are treated at
    the end of the subpass where it is last used.
  * pname:stencilLoadOp is a elink:VkAttachmentLoadOp value specifying how
    the contents of stencil components of the attachment are treated at the
    beginning of the subpass where it is first used.
  * pname:stencilStoreOp is a elink:VkAttachmentStoreOp value specifying how
    the contents of stencil components of the attachment are treated at the
    end of the last subpass where it is used.
  * pname:initialLayout is the layout the attachment image subresource will
    be in when a render pass instance begins.
  * pname:finalLayout is the layout the attachment image subresource will be
    transitioned to when a render pass instance ends.

If the attachment uses a color format, then pname:loadOp and pname:storeOp
are used, and pname:stencilLoadOp and pname:stencilStoreOp are ignored.
If the format has depth and/or stencil components, pname:loadOp and
pname:storeOp apply only to the depth data, while pname:stencilLoadOp and
pname:stencilStoreOp define how the stencil data is handled.
pname:loadOp and pname:stencilLoadOp define the
<<renderpass-load-operations, load operations>> for the attachment.
pname:storeOp and pname:stencilStoreOp define the
<<renderpass-store-operations, store operations>> for the attachment.
If an attachment is not used by any subpass, pname:loadOp, pname:storeOp,
pname:stencilStoreOp, and pname:stencilLoadOp will be ignored for that
attachment, and no load or store ops will be performed.
However, any transition specified by pname:initialLayout and
pname:finalLayout will still be executed.

[[renderpass-aliasing]]
If pname:flags includes ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT, then
the attachment is treated as if it shares physical memory with another
attachment in the same render pass.
This information limits the ability of the implementation to reorder certain
operations (like layout transitions and the pname:loadOp) such that it is
not improperly reordered against other uses of the same physical memory via
a different attachment.
This is described in more detail below.

If a render pass uses multiple attachments that alias the same device
memory, those attachments must: each include the
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT bit in their attachment
description flags.
Attachments aliasing the same memory occurs in multiple ways:

  * Multiple attachments being assigned the same image view as part of
    framebuffer creation.
  * Attachments using distinct image views that correspond to the same image
    subresource of an image.
  * Attachments using views of distinct image subresources which are bound
    to overlapping memory ranges.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Render passes must: include subpass dependencies (either directly or via a
subpass dependency chain) between any two subpasses that operate on the same
attachment or aliasing attachments and those subpass dependencies must:
include execution and memory dependencies separating uses of the aliases, if
at least one of those subpasses writes to one of the aliases.
These dependencies must: not include the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT
if the aliases are views of distinct image subresources which overlap in
memory.
====

Multiple attachments that alias the same memory must: not be used in a
single subpass.
A given attachment index must: not be used multiple times in a single
subpass, with one exception: two subpass attachments can: use the same
attachment index if at least one use is as an input attachment and neither
use is as a resolve or preserve attachment.
In other words, the same view can: be used simultaneously as an input and
color or depth/stencil attachment, but must: not be used as multiple color
or depth/stencil attachments nor as resolve or preserve attachments.

If a set of attachments alias each other, then all except the first to be
used in the render pass must: use an pname:initialLayout of
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, since the earlier uses of the other aliases
make their contents undefined:.
Once an alias has been used and a different alias has been used after it,
the first alias must: not be used in any later subpasses.
However, an application can: assign the same image view to multiple aliasing
attachment indices, which allows that image view to be used multiple times
even if other aliases are used in between.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Once an attachment needs the ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT
bit, there should: be no additional cost of introducing additional aliases,
and using these additional aliases may: allow more efficient clearing of the
attachments on multiple uses via ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR.

slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier defined similarly to the slink:VkMemoryBarrier
above, the queue family indices set to ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED, and
layouts as follows:

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]

When multiview is enabled, the execution of the multiple views of one
subpass may: not occur simultaneously or even back-to-back, and rather may:
be interleaved with the execution of other subpasses.
The load and store operations apply to attachments on a per-view basis.
For example, an attachment using ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR will have
each view cleared on first use, but the first use of one view may be
temporally distant from the first use of another view.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
A good mental model for multiview is to think of a multiview subpass as if
it were a collection of individual (per-view) subpasses that are logically
grouped together and described as a single multiview subpass in the API.
Similarly, a multiview attachment can be thought of like several individual
attachments that happen to be layers in a single image.
A view-local dependency between two multiview subpasses acts like a set of
one-to-one dependencies between corresponding pairs of per-view subpasses.
A view-global dependency between two multiview subpasses acts like a set of
[eq]#N {times} M# dependencies between all pairs of per-view subpasses in
the source and destination.
Thus, it is a more compact representation which also makes clear the
commonality and reuse that is present between views in a subpass.
This interpretation motivates the answers to questions like "`when does the
load op apply`" - it is on the first use of each view of an attachment, as
if each view was a separate attachment.

The content of each view follows the description in
<<renderpass-attachment-contents, attachment content behavior>>.
In particular, if an attachment is preserved, all views within the
attachment are preserved.

The following two alleged implicit dependencies are practically no-ops, as

[[renderpass-implicit-dependencies]]
If there is no subpass dependency from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the
first subpass that uses an attachment, then an implicit subpass dependency
exists from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the first subpass it is used in.
The implicit subpass dependency only exists if there exists an automatic
layout transition away from pname:initialLayout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

dependency exists from the last subpass it is used in to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL.

[[renderpass-layout-transitions]]
As subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to other
subpasses unless a subpass dependency chain describes otherwise, the layout
transitions required between subpasses cannot: be known to an application.
Instead, an application provides the layout that each attachment must: be in
at the start and end of a render pass, and the layout it must: be in during
each subpass it is used in.
The implementation then must: execute layout transitions between subpasses
in order to guarantee that the images are in the layouts required by each
subpass, and in the final layout at the end of the render pass.

Automatic layout transitions apply to the entire image subresource attached
to the framebuffer.
If
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]
multiview is not enabled and
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]
the attachment is a view of a 1D or 2D image, the automatic layout
transitions apply to the number of layers specified by
slink:VkFramebufferCreateInfo::pname:layers.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]
If multiview is enabled and the attachment is a view of a 1D or 2D image,
the automatic layout transitions apply to the layers corresponding to views
which are used by some subpass in the render pass, even if that subpass does
not reference the given attachment.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_maintenance1[]
If the attachment view is a 2D or 2D array view of a 3D image, even if the
attachment view only refers to a subset of the slices of the selected mip
level of the 3D image, automatic layout transitions apply to the entire
subresource referenced which is the entire mip level in this case.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_maintenance1[]

Automatic layout transitions away from the layout used in a subpass
happen-after the availability operations for all dependencies with that
subpass as the pname:srcSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions into the layout used in a subpass happen-before
the visibility operations for all dependencies with that subpass as the
pname:dstSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happen-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses the attachment
that will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happen-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

Automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happen-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses the attachment that
will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happen-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

ifdef::VK_EXT_sample_locations[]

The image layout of the depth aspect of a depth/stencil attachment referring
to an image created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT is dependent
on the last sample locations used to render to the attachment, thus
automatic layout transitions use the sample locations state specified in
slink:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT.

Automatic layout transitions of an attachment referring to a depth/stencil
image created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT use the
sample locations the image subresource range referenced by the attachment
was last rendered with.
If the current render pass does not use the attachment as a depth/stencil
attachment in any subpass that happens-before, the automatic layout
transition uses the sample locations state specified in the
pname:sampleLocationsInfo member of the element of the
sname:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT::pname:pAttachmentInitialSampleLocations
array for which the pname:attachmentIndex member equals the attachment index
of the attachment, if one is specified.
Otherwise, the automatic layout transition uses the sample locations state
specified in the pname:sampleLocationsInfo member of the element of the
sname:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT::pname:pPostSubpassSampleLocations
array for which the pname:subpassIndex member equals the index of the
subpass that last used the attachment as a depth/stencil attachment, if one
is specified.

If no sample locations state has been specified for an automatic layout
transition performed on an attachment referring to a depth/stencil image
created with ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT
the contents of the depth aspect of the depth/stencil attachment become
undefined: as if the layout of the attachment was transitioned from the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED layout.

endif::VK_EXT_sample_locations[]

If two subpasses use the same attachment, and both subpasses use the
attachment in a read-only layout, no subpass dependency needs to be
specified between those subpasses.
If an implementation treats those layouts separately, it must: insert an
implicit subpass dependency between those subpasses to separate the uses in
each layout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

Parameters defined by this structure with the same name as those in

ifdef::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]
If a slink:VkFragmentShadingRateAttachmentInfoKHR structure is included in
the pname:pNext chain, pname:pFragmentShadingRateAttachment is not `NULL`,
and its pname:attachment member is not ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED, the
identified attachment defines a fragment shading rate attachment for that
subpass.
endif::VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate[]

ifdef::VK_ANDROID_external_format_resolve[]
If any element of pname:pResolveAttachments is an image specified with an
slink:VkExternalFormatANDROID, values in the corresponding color attachment
will be resolved to the resolve attachment in the same manner as specified
for <<VkResolveModeFlagBits,
ename:VK_RESOLVE_MODE_EXTERNAL_FORMAT_DOWNSAMPLE_ANDROID>>.

If the <<limits-nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve,
pname:nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve>> limit is ename:VK_TRUE,
values in the color attachment will be loaded from the resolve attachment at
the start of rendering, and may: also be reloaded any time after a resolve
occurs or the resolve attachment is written to; if this occurs it must:
happen-before any writes to the color attachment are performed which
happen-after the resolve that triggers this.
If any color component in the external format is subsampled, values will be
read from the nearest sample in the image when they are loaded.
If the color attachment is also used as an input attachment, the same
behavior applies.

Setting the color attachment to ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED when an external
resolve attachment is used and the
<<limits-nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve,
pname:nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve>> limit is ename:VK_TRUE
will not result in color attachment writes to be discarded for that
attachment.

When <<limits-nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve,
pname:nullColorAttachmentWithExternalFormatResolve>> is ename:VK_TRUE, the
color output from the subpass can still be read via an input attachment; but
the application cannot bind an image view for the color attachment as there
is no such image view bound.
Instead to access the data as an input attachment applications can: use the
resolve attachment in its place - using the resolve attachment image for the
descriptor, and setting the corresponding element of pname:pInputAttachments
to the index of the resolve attachment.

Loads or input attachment reads from the resolve attachment are performed as
if using a slink:VkSamplerYcbcrConversionCreateInfo with the following
parameters:

[source,c]
----
VkSamplerYcbcrConversionCreateInfo createInfo = {
    .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SAMPLER_YCBCR_CONVERSION_CREATE_INFO,
    .pNext = NULL,
    .format = VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED,
    .ycbcrModel = VK_SAMPLER_YCBCR_MODEL_CONVERSION_RGB_IDENTITY,
    .ycbcrRange = VK_SAMPLER_YCBCR_RANGE_ITU_FULL,
    .components = {
        .r = VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_B
        .g = VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_R
        .b = VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_G
        .a = VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_IDENTITY},
    .xChromaOffset = properties.chromaOffsetX,
    .yChromaOffset = properties.chromaOffsetY,
    .chromaFilter = VK_FILTER_NEAREST,
    .forceExplicitReconstruction = ... };
----

where `properties` is equal to
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalFormatResolvePropertiesANDROID returned by the
device and `forceExplicitReconstruction` is effectively ignored as the
ename:VK_SAMPLER_YCBCR_MODEL_CONVERSION_RGB_IDENTITY model is used.
The applied swizzle is the same effective swizzle that would be applied by
the ename:VK_SAMPLER_YCBCR_MODEL_CONVERSION_YCBCR_IDENTITY model, but no
range expansion is applied.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering[or slink:VkRenderingInfo]
includes a slink:VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT structure whose

slink:VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT::pname:rasterizationSamples,
and the subpass attachments can: have a sample count of
ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT.
For attachments with a sample count of ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT,
multisampled rendering is performed to an intermediate multisampled image
with
slink:VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT::pname:rasterizationSamples
samples, implicitly allocated by the implementation for the duration of the
subpass.
For such attachments:

  * If pname:loadOp equals to ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD, samples of
    the implicit image are initialized by replicating the value from the
    corresponding pixel in the attachment.
  * If pname:storeOp or pname:stencilStoreOp is equal to
    ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE, the implicit image is implicitly
    resolved prior to storage in the attachment.

Memory constraints due to high primitive counts may: result in an implicit
split of the subpass.
This is the equivalent of partial rasterization of geometry in a render pass
that ends in pname:storeOp and pname:stencilStoreOp equal to
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE, followed by another render pass with
pname:loadOp and pname:stencilLoadOp equal to
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD with appropriate barriers in between.
When slink:VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT is used, the
implementation is allowed to resolve attachments with a sample count of
ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT and lose multisampled data on such splits.
The implementation may: similarly split the render pass at subpass
boundaries even if they use the same value for
slink:VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT::pname:rasterizationSamples.

[[renderpass-compatibility]]
== Render Pass Compatibility

Framebuffers and graphics pipelines are created based on a specific render
pass object.
They must: only be used with that render pass object, or one compatible with
it.

Two attachment references are compatible if they have matching format and
sample count, or are both ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED or the pointer that
would contain the reference is `NULL`.

Two arrays of attachment references are compatible if all corresponding
pairs of attachments are compatible.
If the arrays are of different lengths, attachment references not present in
the smaller array are treated as ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.

Two render passes are compatible if their corresponding color, input,
resolve, and depth/stencil attachment references are compatible and if they
are otherwise identical except for:

  * Initial and final image layout in attachment descriptions
  * Load and store operations in attachment descriptions
  * Image layout in attachment references

As an additional special case, if two render passes have a single subpass,
the resolve attachment reference
ifdef::VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
and depth/stencil resolve mode
endif::VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
compatibility requirements are ignored.

A framebuffer is compatible with a render pass if it was created using the
same render pass or a compatible render pass.

[open,refpage='VkFramebuffer',desc='Opaque handle to a framebuffer object',type='handles']

Render passes operate in conjunction with _framebuffers_.
Framebuffers represent a collection of specific memory attachments that a
render pass instance uses.

Framebuffers are represented by sname:VkFramebuffer handles:

  * pname:renderPass is a render pass defining what render passes the
    framebuffer will be compatible with.
    See <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass Compatibility>> for details.
  * pname:attachmentCount is the number of attachments.
  * pname:pAttachments is a pointer to an array of slink:VkImageView

endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]

[[renderpass-noattachments]]
It is legal for a subpass to use no color or depth/stencil attachments,
either because it has no attachment references or because all of them are
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.
This kind of subpass can: use shader side effects such as image stores and
atomics to produce an output.
In this case, the subpass continues to use the pname:width, pname:height,
and pname:layers of the framebuffer to define the dimensions of the
rendering area, and the pname:rasterizationSamples from each pipeline's
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo to define the number of samples
used in rasterization; however, if
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures::pname:variableMultisampleRate is
ename:VK_FALSE, then all pipelines to be bound with the subpass must: have
the same value for
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo::pname:rasterizationSamples.
In all such cases, pname:rasterizationSamples must: be a valid
elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits value that is set in
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferNoAttachmentsSampleCounts.

[[renderpass-load-operations]]
== Render Pass Load Operations

Render pass load operations define the initial values of an attachment
during a render pass instance.

Load operations for attachments with a depth/stencil format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT pipeline stage.
Load operations for attachments with a color format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage.
The load operation for each sample in an attachment happens-before any
recorded command which accesses the sample in that render pass instance via
that attachment or an alias.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Because load operations always happen first, external synchronization with
attachment access only needs to synchronize the load operations with
previous commands; not the operations within the render pass instance.

This does not apply when using ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_KHR.
endif::VK_KHR_load_store_op_none,VK_EXT_load_store_op_none[]
====

Load operations only update values within the defined render area for the
render pass instance.
However, any writes performed by a load operation (as defined by its access
masks) to a given attachment may: read and write back any memory locations
within the image subresource bound for that attachment.
For depth/stencil images, writes to one aspect may: also result in
read-modify-write operations for the other aspect.

[[renderpass-precision]]
During a render pass instance, input and color attachments with color
formats that have a component size of 8, 16, or 32 bits must: be represented
in the attachment's format throughout the instance.
Attachments with other floating- or fixed-point color formats, or with depth
components may: be represented in a format with a precision higher than the
attachment format, but must: be represented with the same range.
When such a component is loaded via the pname:loadOp, it will be converted
into an implementation-dependent format used by the render pass.
Such components must: be converted from the render pass format, to the
format of the attachment, before they are resolved or stored at the end of a
render pass instance via pname:storeOp.
Conversions occur as described in <<fundamentals-numerics,Numeric
Representation and Computation>> and <<fundamentals-fixedconv, Fixed-Point
Data Conversions>>.


[[renderpass-store-operations]]

Store operations for attachments with a color format execute in the

The store operation for each sample in an attachment happens-after any
recorded command which accesses the sample via that attachment or an alias.

Because store operations always happen after other accesses in a render pass
instance, external synchronization with attachment access in an earlier

[[renderpass-resolve-operations]]
== Render Pass Multisample Resolve Operations

Render pass multisample resolve operations combine sample values from a
single pixel in a multisample attachment and store the result to the
corresponding pixel in a single sample attachment.

Multisample resolve operations for attachments execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage.
A final resolve operation for all pixels in the render area happens-after
any recorded command which writes a pixel via the multisample attachment to
be resolved or an explicit alias of it in the subpass that it is specified.
Any single sample attachment specified for use in a multisample resolve
operation may: have its contents modified at any point once rendering begins
for the render pass instance.
Reads from the multisample attachment can be synchronized with
ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT.
Access to the single sample attachment can be synchronized with
ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT and
ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
These pipeline stage and access types are used whether the attachments are
color or depth/stencil attachments.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]

When using render pass objects, a subpass dependency specified with the
above pipeline stages and access flags will ensure synchronization with
multisample resolve operations for any attachments that were last accessed
by that subpass.
This allows later subpasses to read resolved values as input attachments.

Resolve operations only update values within the defined render area for the
render pass instance.
However, any writes performed by a resolve operation (as defined by its
access masks) to a given attachment may: read and write back any memory
locations within the image subresource bound for that attachment.
For depth/stencil images writes to one aspect may: also result in
read-modify-write operations for the other aspect.

    Unlike other resolve modes, implementations can resolve multiple times
    during rendering, or even bypass writing to the color attachment
    altogether, as long as the final value is resolved to the resolve
    attachment.

    attachment will be written to the [eq]#Y#, [eq]#C~B~#, and [eq]#C~R~#

The pname:deviceMask serves several purposes.
It is an upper bound on the set of physical devices that can: be used during
the render pass instance, and the initial device mask when the render pass
instance begins.
In addition, commands transitioning to the next subpass in a render pass
instance and commands ending the render pass instance, and, accordingly
render pass <<renderpass-load-operations, load>>,
<<renderpass-store-operations, store>>, and <<renderpass-resolve-operations,
multisample resolve>> operations and subpass dependencies corresponding to
the render pass instance, are executed on the physical devices included in
the device mask provided here.

If pname:deviceRenderAreaCount is not zero, then the elements of
pname:pDeviceRenderAreas override the value of
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pname:renderArea, and provide a render area
specific to each physical device.
These render areas serve the same purpose as
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pname:renderArea, including controlling the
region of attachments that are cleared by ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR
and that are resolved into resolve attachments.

If this structure is not present, the render pass instance's device mask is
the value of slink:VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo::pname:deviceMask.
If this structure is not present or if pname:deviceRenderAreaCount is zero,
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pname:renderArea is used for all physical

== Common Render Pass Data Races (Informative)

Due to the complexity of how rendering is performed, there are several ways
an application can accidentally introduce a data race, usually by doing
something that may seem benign but actually cannot be supported.
This section indicates a number of the more common cases as guidelines to
help avoid them.


=== Sampling From a Read-only Attachment

Vulkan includes read-only layouts for depth/stencil images, that allow the
images to be both read during a render pass for the purposes of
depth/stencil tests, and read as a non-attachment.

However, because ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE and
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE may perform write operations, even if
no recorded command writes to an attachment, reading from an image while
also using it as an attachment with these store operations can result in a
data race.
If the reads from the non-attachment are performed in a fragment shader
where the accessed samples match those covered by the fragment shader, no
data race will occur as store operations are guaranteed to operate after
fragment shader execution for the set of samples the fragment covers.
Notably, input attachments can also be used for this case.
Reading other samples or in any other shader stage can result in unexpected
behavior due to the potential for a data race, and validation errors should
be generated for doing so.
In practice, many applications have shipped reading samples outside of the
covered fragment without any observable issue, but there is no guarantee
that this will always work, and it is not advisable to rely on this in new
or re-worked code bases.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_KHR_load_store_op_none,VK_EXT_load_store_op_none,VK_QCOM_render_pass_store_ops,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering[]
As ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE is guaranteed to perform no writes,
applications wishing to read an image as both an attachment and a
non-attachment should make use of this store operation, coupled with a load
operation that also performs no writes.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_3,VK_KHR_load_store_op_none,VK_EXT_load_store_op_none,VK_QCOM_render_pass_store_ops,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering[]


=== Non-overlapping Access Between Resources

When relying on non-overlapping accesses between attachments and other
resources, it is important to note that <<renderpass-load-operations, load>>
and <<renderpass-store-operations, store>> operations have fairly wide
alignment requirements - potentially affecting entire subresources and
adjacent depth/stencil aspects.
This makes it invalid to access a non-attachment subresource that is
simultaneously being used as an attachment where either access performs a
write operation.

ifdef::VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout[]
The only exception to this is if a subresource is in the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT image layout, in
which case the overlap is defined to occur at a per-pixel granularity, and
applications can read data from pixels outside the render area without
introducing a data race.
endif::VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout[]


=== Depth/Stencil and Input Attachments

When rendering to only the depth OR stencil aspect of an image, an input
attachment accessing the other aspect will
ifndef::VK_KHR_maintenance2[]
always result in a data race.
endif::VK_KHR_maintenance2[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_maintenance2[]
not cause a data race only under very specific conditions.
To avoid a data race, the aspect not being written must be in a read-only
layout, and writes to it must be disabled in the draw state.
For example, to read from stencil while writing depth, the attachment must
be in ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL (or
equivalent), and the stencil write mask must be set to 0.
Similarly to read from depth while writing stencil, the attachment must be
in ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL (or
equivalent), and depth write enable must be set to ename:VK_FALSE.

=== Synchronization Options

There are several synchronization options available to synchronize between
accesses to resources within a render pass.
Some of the options are outlined below:

  * A slink:VkSubpassDependency in a render pass object can synchronize
    attachment writes and <<renderpass-resolve-operations, multisample
    resolve operations>> from a prior subpass for subsequent input
    attachment reads.
  * A flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier inside a subpass can synchronize prior
    attachment writes in the subpass with subsequent input attachment reads.
ifdef::VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout[]
  * A flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier inside a subpass can synchronize prior
    attachment writes in the subpass with subsequent non-attachment reads if
    the attachment is in the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT image layout.
endif::VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout[]
ifdef::VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access,VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access[]
  * If a subresource is used as a color and input attachment, and the
    pipeline performing the read was created with
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT
  * If a subresource is used as a depth and input attachment, and the
    pipeline performing the read was created with
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT
  * If a subresource is used as a stencil and input attachment, and the
    pipeline performing the read was created with
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT
endif::VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access,VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access[]
ifdef::VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock[]
  * If a subresource is used as two separate non-attachment resources,
    writes to a pixel or individual sample in a fragment shader can be
    synchronized with access to the same pixel or sample in another fragment
    shader by using one of the <<shaders-scope-fragment-interlock, fragment
    interlock>> execution modes.
