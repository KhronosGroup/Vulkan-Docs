== AV1 Decode Operations

Video decode operations using an <<decode-av1-profile,AV1 decode profile>>
can: be used to decode elementary video stream sequences compliant with the
<<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Refer to the <<preamble,Preamble>> for information on how the Khronos
Intellectual Property Rights Policy relates to normative references to
external materials not created by Khronos.
====

This process is performed according to the <<decode-operation-steps,video
decode operation steps>> with the codec-specific semantics defined in
section 7 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>:

  * Syntax elements, derived values, and other parameters are applied from
    the following structures:
  ** The code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader structure stored in the bound video
     session parameters object specifying the
     <<decode-av1-active-sequence-header,active sequence header>>.
  ** The code:StdVideoDecodeAV1PictureInfo structure specifying the
     <<decode-av1-picture-info,AV1 picture information>>.
  ** The code:StdVideoDecodeAV1ReferenceInfo structures specifying the
     <<decode-av1-reference-info,AV1 reference information>> corresponding
     to the optional <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> and any
     <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>>.
  * The contents of the provided video bitstream buffer range are
    interpreted as defined in the <<decode-av1-bitstream-data-access,AV1
    Decode Bitstream Data Access>> section.
  * Picture data in the <<video-picture-resources,video picture resources>>
    corresponding to the used <<decode-av1-active-reference-picture-info,
    active reference pictures>>, <<decode-av1-output-picture-info,decode
    output picture>>, and optional <<decode-av1-reconstructed-picture-info,
    reconstructed picture>> is accessed as defined in the
    <<decode-av1-picture-data-access,AV1 Decode Picture Data Access>>
    section.
  * The decision on <<decode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>> is made
    according to the parameters specified in the
    <<decode-av1-ref-pic-setup,AV1 picture information>>.

If the parameters and the bitstream adhere to the syntactic and semantic
requirements defined in the corresponding sections of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
Specification>>, as described above, and the <<dpb-slot,DPB slots>>
associated with the <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>>
all refer to <<dpb-slot-states,valid picture references>>, then the video
decode operation will complete successfully.
Otherwise, the video decode operation may: complete
<<decode-unsuccessful,unsuccessfully>>.


[[decode-av1-bitstream-data-access]]
=== AV1 Decode Bitstream Data Access

The video bitstream buffer range should: contain one or more frame OBUs,
comprised of a frame header OBU and tile group OBU, that together represent
an entire frame, as defined in sections 5.10, 5.9, and 5.11, and this data
is interpreted as defined in sections 6.9, 6.8, and 6.10 of the
<<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>, respectively.

The offset specified in
slink:VkVideoDecodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:frameHeaderOffset should:
specify the starting offset of the frame header OBU of the frame.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When the tiles of the frame are encoded into multiple tile groups, each
frame OBU has a separate frame header OBU but their content is expected to
match per the requirements of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
Accordingly, the offset specified in pname:frameHeaderOffset can: be the
offset of any of the otherwise identical frame header OBUs when multiple
tile groups are present.
====

The offsets and sizes provided in
slink:VkVideoDecodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:pTileOffsets and
slink:VkVideoDecodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:pTileSizes, respectively,
should: specify the starting offsets and sizes corresponding to each tile
within the video bitstream buffer range.


[[decode-av1-picture-data-access]]
=== AV1 Decode Picture Data Access

Accesses to image data within a video picture resource happen at the
granularity indicated by
slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR::pname:pictureAccessGranularity, as returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR for the used <<video-profiles,
video profile>>.
Accordingly, the complete image subregion of a
<<decode-output-picture,decode output picture>>,
<<reference-picture,reference picture>>, or
<<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> accessed by video coding
operations using an <<decode-av1-profile,AV1 decode profile>> is defined as
the set of texels within the coordinate range:

  {empty}:: [eq]#([0,pname:endX),[0,pname:endY))#

Where:

  * [eq]#pname:endX# equals [eq]#pname:codedExtent.width# rounded up to the
    nearest integer multiple of pname:pictureAccessGranularity.width and
    clamped to the width of the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the corresponding
    slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure;
  * [eq]#endY# equals [eq]#pname:codedExtent.height# rounded up to the
    nearest integer multiple of pname:pictureAccessGranularity.height and
    clamped to the height of the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference, referred>> to by the corresponding
    slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure;

Where pname:codedExtent is the member of the
slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure corresponding to the picture.

In case of video decode operations using an <<decode-av1-profile,AV1 decode
profile>>, any access to a picture at the coordinates
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)#, as defined by the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
Specification>>, is an access to the image subresource
<<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the corresponding
slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure at the texel coordinates
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)#.


[[decode-av1-reference-names]]
=== AV1 Reference Names and Semantics

Individual reference frames used in the decoding process have different
semantics, as defined in section 6.10.24 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
Specification>>.
The AV1 semantics associated with a reference picture are indicated by the
corresponding enumeration constant defined in the Video Std enumeration type
code:StdVideoAV1ReferenceName:

  * code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_INTRA_FRAME identifies the reference
    used for intra coding (code:INTRA_FRAME), as defined in sections 2 and
    7.11.2 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
  * All other enumeration constants refer to forward or backward references
    used for inter coding, as defined in sections 2 and 7.11.3 of the
    <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>:
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST2_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST2_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST3_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST3_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_GOLDEN_FRAME identifies the
     code:GOLDEN_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_BWDREF_FRAME identifies the
     code:BWDREF_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_ALTREF2_FRAME identifies the
     code:ALTREF2_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_ALTREF_FRAME identifies the
     code:ALTREF_FRAME reference

These enumeration constants are not directly used in any APIs but are used
to indirectly index into certain Video Std and Vulkan API parameter arrays.

ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_DECODE_AV1_BIT_KHR and adding a
sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR structure to the
slink:VkVideoProfileInfoKHR::pname:pNext chain.

The sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoDecodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:stdProfile is a code:StdVideoAV1Profile value specifying the AV1
    codec profile, as defined in section A.2 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1

  * [[decode-av1-film-grain-support]] pname:filmGrainSupport specifies
    whether AV1 film grain, as defined in section 7.8.3 of the
    <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>, can: be used with the video profile.
    When this member is set to ename:VK_TRUE, video session objects created
    against the video profile will be able to decode pictures that have
    <<decode-av1-film-grain,film grain>> enabled.

[NOTE]

=== AV1 Decode Capabilities

[open,refpage='VkVideoDecodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR',desc='Structure describing AV1 decode capabilities',type='structs']
--
When calling flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR to query the
capabilities for an <<decode-av1-profile,AV1 decode profile>>, the
slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR::pname:pNext chain must: include a
sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR structure that will be filled with the
profile-specific capabilities.

The sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoDecodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR.adoc[]

[[decode-av1-parameter-sets]]
=== AV1 Decode Parameter Sets

<<video-session-parameters,Video session parameters>> objects created with
the video codec operation ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_DECODE_AV1_BIT_KHR
contain a single instance of the following parameter set:

:operationType: decode

When a <<video-session-parameters,video session parameters>> object is
created with the codec operation
ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_DECODE_AV1_BIT_KHR, the
slink:VkVideoSessionParametersCreateInfoKHR::pname:pNext chain must: include
a sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1SessionParametersCreateInfoKHR structure specifying
the contents of the object.

The sname:VkVideoDecodeAV1SessionParametersCreateInfoKHR structure is
defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoDecodeAV1SessionParametersCreateInfoKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this

  * pname:pStdSequenceHeader is a pointer to a
    code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader structure describing the
    <<decode-av1-sequence-header,AV1 sequence header>> entry to store in the
    created object.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
As AV1 video session parameters objects will only ever contain a single AV1
sequence header, this has to be specified at object creation time and such
video session parameters objects cannot be updated using the
flink:vkUpdateVideoSessionParametersKHR command.
When a new AV1 sequence header is decoded from the input video bitstream the
application needs to create a new video session parameters object to store
it.

[[decode-av1-ref-pic-setup]]
Reference picture setup is controlled by the value of

picture>> is specified, then the latter is used as the target of picture
reconstruction to <<dpb-slot-states,activate>> the <<dpb-slot,DPB slot>>
specified in pname:pDecodeInfo->pSetupReferenceSlot->slotIndex.
If code:StdVideoDecodeAV1PictureInfo::pname:refresh_frame_flags is zero, but

then the corresponding picture reference associated with the <<dpb-slot,DPB
slot>> is invalidated, as described in the <<dpb-slot-states,DPB Slot
States>> section.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When the AV1 reference information is provided for the reconstructed
picture, certain parameters (e.g. code:frame_type) are specified both in the
<<decode-av1-picture-info,AV1 picture information>> and in the AV1 reference
information.
This is necessary because unlike the AV1 picture information, which is only
used for the purposes of the video decode operation in question, the AV1
reference information specified for the reconstructed picture may: be
associated with the activated DPB slot, meaning that some implementations
may: maintain it as part of the <<reference-metadata,reference picture
metadata>> corresponding to the video picture resource associated with the
DPB slot.
When the AV1 reference information is provided for an active reference
picture, the specified parameters correspond to the parameters specified
when the DPB slot was activated (set up) with the reference picture, as
usual, in order to communicate these parameters for implementations that do
not maintain any subset of these parameters as part of the DPB slot's
<<reference-metadata,reference picture metadata>>.

=== AV1 Decode Requirements

This section describes the required: AV1 decoding capabilities for physical
devices that have at least one queue family that supports the video codec
operation ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_DECODE_AV1_BIT_KHR, as returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties2 in
slink:VkQueueFamilyVideoPropertiesKHR::pname:videoCodecOperations.

    The *Requirement Type* column specifies the requirement is either the
    minimum value all implementations must: support, the maximum value all
    implementations must: support, or the exact value all implementations
    must: support.
    For bitmasks a minimum value is the least bits all implementations must:
    set, but they may: have additional bits set beyond this minimum.
