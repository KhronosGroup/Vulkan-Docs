= Copy Commands

An application can: copy buffer and image data using several methods
described in this chapter, depending on the type of data transfer.

All copy commands are treated as "`transfer`" operations for the purposes of
synchronization barriers.

All copy commands that have a source format with an X component in its
format description read undefined: values from those bits.

All copy commands that have a destination format with an X component in its
format description write undefined: values to those bits.

== Copying Data Between Buffers and Images

Data can: be copied between buffers and images, enabling applications to
load and store data between images and user defined offsets in buffer
memory.

[[copies-buffers-images-addressing]]
When copying between a buffer and an image, whole texel blocks are always
copied; each texel block in the specified extent in the image to be copied
will be written to a region in the buffer, specified according to the
position of the texel block, and the <<formats-compatibility-classes,texel
block extent>> and size of the format being copied.

For a set of coordinates [eq]#(x,y,z,layer)#, where:

  {empty}:: [eq]#x# is in the range [eq]#[pname:imageOffset.x / blockWidth,
    {lceil}(pname:imageOffset.x {plus} pname:imageExtent.width) /
    blockWidth{rceil})#,
  {empty}:: [eq]#y# is in the range [eq]#[pname:imageOffset.y / blockHeight,
    {lceil}(pname:imageOffset.y {plus} pname:imageExtent.height) /
    blockHeight{rceil})#,
  {empty}:: [eq]#z# is in the range [eq]#[pname:imageOffset.z / blockDepth,
    {lceil}(pname:imageOffset.z {plus} pname:imageExtent.depth) /
    blockDepth{rceil})#,
  {empty}:: [eq]#layer# is in the range
    [pname:imageSubresource.baseArrayLayer,
    pname:imageSubresource.baseArrayLayer {plus}
    pname:imageSubresource.layerCount),

and where [eq]#blockWidth#, [eq]#blockHeight#, and [eq]#blockDepth# are the
dimensions of the <<formats-compatibility-classes,texel block extent>> of
the image's format.

For each [eq]#(x,y,z,layer)# coordinate, texels in the image layer selected
by [eq]#layer# are accessed in the following ranges:

  {empty}:: [eq]#[x {times} blockWidth, max( (x {times} blockWidth) {plus}
            blockWidth, imageWidth) )#

  {empty}:: [eq]#[z {times} blockDepth, max( (z {times} blockDepth) {plus}
            blockDepth, imageDepth) )#

where [eq]#imageWidth#, [eq]#imageHeight#, and [eq]#imageDepth# are the
dimensions of the image subresource.

For each [eq]#(x,y,z,layer)# coordinate, bytes in the buffer are accessed at
offsets in the range [eq]#[texelOffset, texelOffset {plus} blockSize)#,
where:

  {empty}:: [eq]#texelOffset = pname:bufferOffset {plus} (x {times}

If a rotation is specified by slink:VkCopyCommandTransformInfoQCOM, the 2D
region of the image being addressed is rotated around the offset, modifying
the range of [eq]#x# and [eq]#y# coordinates for the image address according
to the specified elink:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR:

  * If ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR is specified, no rotation

      {empty}:: [eq]#imageWidth' = imageHeight#
      {empty}:: [eq]#imageHeight' = imageWidth#

When rotation is performed, for each [eq]#(x,y,z,layer)# coordinate, texels
in the image layer selected by [eq]#layer# are instead accessed in the
following ranges:

  {empty}:: [eq]#[z' {times} blockDepth', max( (z' {times} blockDepth')
            {plus} blockDepth', imageDepth') )#

Buffer addressing calculations are unaffected by this rotation.

[[copies-buffers-images-depth-stencil]]
When copying between a buffer and the depth or stencil aspect of an image,
data in the buffer is assumed to be laid out as separate planes rather than
interleaved.
Addressing calculations are thus performed for a different format than the
base image, according to the aspect, as described in the following table:

== Image Copies with Scaling

[open,refpage='vkCmdBlitImage',desc='Copy regions of an image, potentially performing format conversion,',type='protos']
--
:refpage: vkCmdBlitImage

To copy regions of a source image into a destination image, potentially
performing format conversion, arbitrary scaling, and filtering, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdBlitImage.adoc[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:srcImage is the source image.
  * pname:srcImageLayout is the layout of the source image subresources for
    the blit.
  * pname:dstImage is the destination image.
  * pname:dstImageLayout is the layout of the destination image subresources
    for the blit.
  * pname:regionCount is the number of regions to blit.
  * pname:pRegions is a pointer to an array of slink:VkImageBlit structures
    specifying the regions to blit.
  * pname:filter is a elink:VkFilter specifying the filter to apply if the
    blits require scaling.

fname:vkCmdBlitImage must: not be used for multisampled source or
destination images.
Use flink:vkCmdResolveImage for this purpose.

As the sizes of the source and destination extents can: differ in any
dimension, texels in the source extent are scaled and filtered to the
destination extent.
Scaling occurs via the following operations:

  * For each destination texel, the integer coordinate of that texel is
    converted to an unnormalized texture coordinate, using the effective
    inverse of the equations described in
    <<textures-unnormalized-to-integer, unnormalized to integer
    conversion>>:
  {empty}:: [eq]#u~base~ = i {plus} {onehalf}#
  {empty}:: [eq]#v~base~ = j {plus} {onehalf}#
  {empty}:: [eq]#w~base~ = k {plus} {onehalf}#
  * These base coordinates are then offset by the first destination offset:
  {empty}:: [eq]#u~offset~ = u~base~ - x~dst0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#v~offset~ = v~base~ - y~dst0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#w~offset~ = w~base~ - z~dst0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#a~offset~ = a - pname:baseArrayCount~dst~#
  * The scale is determined from the source and destination regions, and
    applied to the offset coordinates:
  {empty}:: [eq]#scale~u~ = (x~src1~ - x~src0~) / (x~dst1~ - x~dst0~)#
  {empty}:: [eq]#scale~v~ = (y~src1~ - y~src0~) / (y~dst1~ - y~dst0~)#
  {empty}:: [eq]#scale~w~ = (z~src1~ - z~src0~) / (z~dst1~ - z~dst0~)#
  {empty}:: [eq]#u~scaled~ = u~offset~ {times} scale~u~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#v~scaled~ = v~offset~ {times} scale~v~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#w~scaled~ = w~offset~ {times} scale~w~#
  * Finally the source offset is added to the scaled coordinates, to
    determine the final unnormalized coordinates used to sample from
    pname:srcImage:
  {empty}:: [eq]#u = u~scaled~ {plus} x~src0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#v = v~scaled~ {plus} y~src0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#w = w~scaled~ {plus} z~src0~#
  {empty}:: [eq]#q = pname:mipLevel#
  {empty}:: [eq]#a = a~offset~ {plus} pname:baseArrayCount~src~#

These coordinates are used to sample from the source image, as described in
<<textures, Image Operations chapter>>, with the filter mode equal to that
of pname:filter, a mipmap mode of ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST and
an address mode of ename:VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
Implementations must: clamp at the edge of the source image, and may:
additionally clamp to the edge of the source region.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Due to allowable rounding errors in the generation of the source texture
coordinates, it is not always possible to guarantee exactly which source
texels will be sampled for a given blit.
As rounding errors are implementation-dependent, the exact results of a
blitting operation are also implementation-dependent.
====

Blits are done layer by layer starting with the pname:baseArrayLayer member
of pname:srcSubresource for the source and pname:dstSubresource for the
destination.
pname:layerCount layers are blitted to the destination image.

When blitting 3D textures, slices in the destination region bounded by
pname:dstOffsets[0].z and pname:dstOffsets[1].z are sampled from slices in
the source region bounded by pname:srcOffsets[0].z and
pname:srcOffsets[1].z.
If the pname:filter parameter is ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR then the value
sampled from the source image is taken by doing linear filtering using the
interpolated *z* coordinate represented by *w* in the previous equations.
If the pname:filter parameter is ename:VK_FILTER_NEAREST then the value
sampled from the source image is taken from the single nearest slice, with
an implementation-dependent arithmetic rounding mode.

The following filtering and conversion rules apply:

  * Integer formats can: only be converted to other integer formats with the
    same signedness.
  * No format conversion is supported between depth/stencil images.
    The formats must: match.
  * Format conversions on unorm, snorm, scaled and packed float formats of
    the copied aspect of the image are performed by first converting the
    pixels to float values.
  * For sRGB source formats, nonlinear RGB values are converted to linear
    representation prior to filtering.
  * After filtering, the float values are first clamped and then cast to the
    destination image format.
    In case of sRGB destination format, linear RGB values are converted to
    nonlinear representation before writing the pixel to the image.

Signed and unsigned integers are converted by first clamping to the
representable range of the destination format, then casting the value.

values for each pixel are resolved in an implementation-dependent manner.
If the source formats are integer types, a single sample's value is selected
for each pixel.

pname:srcOffset and pname:dstOffset select the initial pname:x, pname:y, and
pname:z offsets in texels of the sub-regions of the source and destination
image data.
pname:extent is the size in texels of the source image to resolve in
