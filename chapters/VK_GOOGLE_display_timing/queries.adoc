To query the duration of a refresh cycle (RC) for the presentation engine's
display, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the device associated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to obtain the refresh duration for.
  * pname:pDisplayTimingProperties is a pointer to a
    sname:VkRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE structure.

The sname:VkRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE.adoc[]

  * pname:refreshDuration is the number of nanoseconds from the start of one
    refresh cycle to the next.

The implementation will maintain a limited amount of history of timing
information about previous presents.
Because of the asynchronous nature of the presentation engine, the timing
information for a given flink:vkQueuePresentKHR command will become
available some time later.
These time values can be asynchronously queried, and will be returned if
available.
All time values are in nanoseconds, relative to a monotonically-increasing
clock (e.g. `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (see clock_gettime(2)) on Android and Linux).

To asynchronously query the presentation engine, for newly-available timing
information about one or more previous presents to a given swapchain, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the device associated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to obtain presentation timing
    information duration for.
  * pname:pPresentationTimingCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structures to query, as
    described below.
  * pname:pPresentationTimings is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structures.

If pname:pPresentationTimings is `NULL`, then the number of newly-available
timing records for the given pname:swapchain is returned in
pname:pPresentationTimingCount.
Otherwise, pname:pPresentationTimingCount must: point to a variable set by
the user to the number of elements in the pname:pPresentationTimings array,
and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures
actually written to pname:pPresentationTimings.
If the value of pname:pPresentationTimingCount is less than the number of
newly-available timing records, at most pname:pPresentationTimingCount
structures will be written, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead
of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available timing records
were returned.

The sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE.adoc[]

  * pname:presentID is an application-provided value that was given to a
    previous fname:vkQueuePresentKHR command via
    slink:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:presentID (see below).
    It can: be used to uniquely identify a previous present with the
    flink:vkQueuePresentKHR command.
  * pname:desiredPresentTime is an application-provided value that was given
    to a previous flink:vkQueuePresentKHR command via
    slink:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime.
    If non-zero, it was used by the application to indicate that an image
    not be presented any sooner than pname:desiredPresentTime.
  * pname:actualPresentTime is the time when the image of the
    pname:swapchain was actually displayed.
  * pname:earliestPresentTime is the time when the image of the
    pname:swapchain could have been displayed.
    This may: differ from pname:actualPresentTime if the application
    requested that the image be presented no sooner than
    slink:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime.
  * pname:presentMargin is an indication of how early the
    fname:vkQueuePresentKHR command was processed compared to how soon it
    needed to be processed, and still be presented at
    pname:earliestPresentTime.

The results for a given pname:swapchain and pname:presentID are only
returned once from fname:vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE.

The application can: use the sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE values to
occasionally adjust its timing.
For example, if pname:actualPresentTime is later than expected (e.g. one
pname:refreshDuration late), the application may increase its target IPD to
a higher multiple of pname:refreshDuration (e.g. decrease its frame rate
from 60Hz to 30Hz).
If pname:actualPresentTime and pname:earliestPresentTime are consistently
different, and if pname:presentMargin is consistently large enough, the
application may decrease its target IPD to a smaller multiple of
pname:refreshDuration (e.g. increase its frame rate from 30Hz to 60Hz).
If pname:actualPresentTime and pname:earliestPresentTime are same, and if
pname:presentMargin is consistently high, the application may delay the
start of its input-render-present loop in order to decrease the latency
between user input and the corresponding present (always leaving some margin
in case a new image takes longer to render than the previous image).
An application that desires its target IPD to always be the same as
pname:refreshDuration, can also adjust features until
pname:actualPresentTime is never late and pname:presentMargin is
satisfactory.

The full `apiext:VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` extension semantics are described
for swapchains created with ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR.
For example, non-zero values of
sname:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime must: be honored, and
fname:vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE should: return a
sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure with valid values for all
images presented with fname:vkQueuePresentKHR.
The semantics for other present modes are as follows:

  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR.
    The presentation engine may: ignore non-zero values of
    sname:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime in favor of
    presenting immediately.
    The value of
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::pname:earliestPresentTime must: be
    the same as
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::pname:actualPresentTime, which
    should: be when the presentation engine displayed the image.
  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR.
    The intention of using this present mode with this extension is to
    handle cases where an image is presented late, and the next image is
    presented soon enough to replace it at the next vertical blanking
    period.
    For images that are displayed to the user, the value of
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::pname:actualPresentTime must: be
    when the image was displayed.
    For images that are not displayed to the user,
    fname:vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE may: not return a
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure, or it may: return a
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure with the value of zero
    for both sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::pname:actualPresentTime
    and sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::pname:earliestPresentTime.
    It is possible that an application can: submit images with
    sname:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime values such that new
    images may: not be displayed.
    For example, if sname:VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::pname:desiredPresentTime is
    far enough in the future that an image is not presented before
    fname:vkQueuePresentKHR is called to present another image, the first
    image will not be displayed to the user.
    If the application continues to do that, the presentation engine may: not
    display new images.
  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR.
    For images that are presented in time to be displayed at the next
    vertical blanking period, the semantics are identical as for
    ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR.
    For images that are presented late, and are displayed after the start of
    the vertical blanking period (i.e. with tearing), the values of
    sname:VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE may: be treated as if the image was
    displayed at the start of the vertical blanking period, or may: be
    treated the same as for ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR.
