Acceleration structures are an opaque structure that is built by the
implementation to more efficiently perform spatial queries on the provided
geometric data.
For this extension, an acceleration structure is either a top-level
acceleration structure containing a set of bottom-level acceleration
structures or a bottom-level acceleration structure containing either a set
of axis-aligned bounding boxes for custom geometry or a set of triangles.

Each instance in the top-level acceleration structure contains a reference
to a bottom-level acceleration structure as well as an instance transform
plus information required to index into the shader bindings.
The top-level acceleration structure is what is bound to the acceleration
descriptor to trace inside the shader in the ray tracing pipeline.

Acceleration structures are represented by sname:VkAccelerationStructureKHR
handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkAccelerationStructureKHR.txt[]

ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[]
or the equivalent

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkAccelerationStructureNV.txt[]

To create acceleration structures, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateAccelerationStructureNV.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the buffer object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoNV structure containing
    parameters affecting creation of the acceleration structure.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pAccelerationStructure is a pointer to a
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureNV handle in which the resulting
    acceleration structure object is returned.

Similar to other objects in Vulkan, the acceleration structure creation
merely creates an object with a specific "`shape`" as specified by the
information in slink:VkAccelerationStructureInfoNV and pname:compactedSize
in pname:pCreateInfo.
Populating the data in the object after allocating and binding memory is
done with flink:vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructureNV and
flink:vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureNV.

Acceleration structure creation uses the count and type information from the
geometries, but does not use the data references in the structures.

To create an acceleration structure, call:

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the buffer object.

Similar to other objects in Vulkan, the acceleration structure creation
merely creates an object with a specific "`shape`".
The type and quantity of geometry that can be built into an acceleration
structure is determined by the parameters of
slink:VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR.

Populating the data in the object after allocating and binding memory is
done with commands such as flink:vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructureKHR,
flink:vkBuildAccelerationStructureKHR,
flink:vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureKHR, and
flink:vkCopyAccelerationStructureKHR.

The input buffers passed to acceleration structure build commands will be
referenced by the implementation for the duration of the command.
After the command completes, the acceleration structure may: hold a
reference to any acceleration structure specified by an active instance
contained therein.
Apart from this referencing, acceleration structures must: be fully
self-contained.
The application may: re-use or free any memory which was used by the command
as an input or as scratch without affecting the results of ray traversal.
