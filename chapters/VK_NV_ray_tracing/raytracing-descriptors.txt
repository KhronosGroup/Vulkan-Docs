The sname:VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR.txt[]

ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[]
or the equivalent

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV.txt[]
endif::VK_NV_ray_tracing[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:accelerationStructureCount is the number of elements in
    pname:pAccelerationStructures.
  * pname:pAccelerationStructures are the acceleration structures to update.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR-accelerationStructureCount-02236]]
    pname:accelerationStructureCount must: be equal to pname:descriptorCount
    in the extended structure
  * [[VUID-VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR-pAccelerationStructures-02764]]
    Each acceleration structure in pname:pAccelerationStructures must: have
    been created with ename:VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_TOP_LEVEL_KHR
