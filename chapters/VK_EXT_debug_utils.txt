== Debug Utilities

Vulkan provides flexible debugging utilities for debugging an application.

The <<debugging-object-debug-annotation,Object Debug Annotation>> section
describes how to associate either a name or binary data with a specific
Vulkan object.

The <<debugging-queue-labels,Queue Labels>> section describes how to
annotate and group the work submitted to a queue.

The <<debugging-command-buffer-labels,Command Buffer Labels>> section
describes how to associate logical elements of the scene with commands in a
slink:VkCommandBuffer.

The <<debugging-debug-messengers,Debug Messengers>> section describes how to
create debug messenger objects associated with an application supplied
callback to capture debug messages from a variety of Vulkan components.

[[debugging-object-debug-annotation]]
=== Object Debug Annotation

It can be useful for an application to provide its own content relative to a
specific Vulkan object.
The following commands allow application developers to associate
user-defined information with Vulkan objects.

[[debugging-object-naming]]
==== Object Naming

An object can be provided a user-defined name by calling
fname:vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT as defined below.

[open,refpage='vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT',desc='Give a user-friendly name to an object',type='protos']
--

include::../api/protos/vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT.txt[]

  * pname:device is the device that created the object.
  * pname:pNameInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT structure specifying the parameters
    of the name to set on the object.

include::../validity/protos/vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT',desc='Specify parameters of a name to give to an object',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:objectType is a elink:VkObjectType specifying the type of the
    object to be named.
  * pname:objectHandle is the object to be named.
  * pname:pObjectName is a null-terminated UTF-8 string specifying the name
    to apply to pname:objectHandle.

Applications may: change the name associated with an object simply by
calling fname:vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT again with a new string.
If pname:pObjectName is an empty string, then any previously set name is
removed.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT-objectType-01905]]
    pname:objectType must: not be ename:VK_OBJECT_TYPE_UNKNOWN
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT-objectHandle-01906]]
    pname:objectHandle must: not be dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT-objectHandle-01907]]
    pname:objectHandle must: be a Vulkan object of the type associated with
    pname:objectType as defined in <<debugging-object-types>>.

[[debugging-object-data-association]]
==== Object Data Association

In addition to setting a name for an object, debugging and validation layers
may: have uses for additional binary data on a per-object basis that have no
other place in the Vulkan API.

For example, a sname:VkShaderModule could have additional debugging data
attached to it to aid in offline shader tracing.

Additional data can be attached to an object by calling
fname:vkSetDebugUtilsObjectTagEXT as defined below.

[open,refpage='vkSetDebugUtilsObjectTagEXT',desc='Attach arbitrary data to an object',type='protos']
--

include::../api/protos/vkSetDebugUtilsObjectTagEXT.txt[]

  * pname:device is the device that created the object.
  * pname:pTagInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT structure specifying the parameters
    of the tag to attach to the object.

include::../validity/protos/vkSetDebugUtilsObjectTagEXT.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT',desc='Specify parameters of a tag to attach to an object',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:objectType is a elink:VkObjectType specifying the type of the
    object to be named.
  * pname:objectHandle is the object to be tagged.
  * pname:tagName is a numerical identifier of the tag.
  * pname:tagSize is the number of bytes of data to attach to the object.
  * pname:pTag is an array of pname:tagSize bytes containing the data to be
    associated with the object.

The pname:tagName parameter gives a name or identifier to the type of data
being tagged.
This can be used by debugging layers to easily filter for only data that can
be used by that implementation.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT-objectType-01908]]
    pname:objectType must: not be ename:VK_OBJECT_TYPE_UNKNOWN
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT-objectHandle-01909]]
    pname:objectHandle must: not be dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectTagInfoEXT-objectHandle-01910]]
    pname:objectHandle must: be a Vulkan object of the type associated with
    pname:objectType as defined in <<debugging-object-types>>.

[[debugging-queue-labels]]
=== Queue Labels

All Vulkan work must be submitted using queues.
It is possible for an application to use multiple queues, each containing
multiple command buffers, when performing work.
It can be useful to identify which queue, or even where in a queue,
something has occurred.

To begin identifying a region using a debug label inside a queue, you may
use the flink:vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT command.

Then, when the region of interest has passed, you may end the label region
using flink:vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT.

Additionally, a single debug label may be inserted at any time using
flink:vkQueueInsertDebugUtilsLabelEXT.

[open,refpage='vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT',desc='Open a queue debug label region',type='protos']
--

A queue debug label region is opened by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:queue is the queue in which to start a debug label region.
  * pname:pLabelInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT structure specifying the parameters of the
    label region to open.

include::../validity/protos/vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

The sname:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:pLabelName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string that
    contains the name of the label.
  * pname:color is an optional RGBA color value that can be associated with
    the label.
    A particular implementation may: choose to ignore this color value.
    The values contain RGBA values in order, in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
    If all elements in pname:color are set to 0.0 then it is ignored.

include::../validity/structs/VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT',desc='Close a queue debug label region',type='protos']
--

A queue debug label region is closed by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:queue is the queue in which a debug label region should be closed.

The calls to flink:vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT and
flink:vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT must: be matched and balanced.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT-None-01911]]
    There must: be an outstanding fname:vkQueueBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT
    command prior to the fname:vkQueueEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT on the queue
****

--

[open,refpage='vkQueueInsertDebugUtilsLabelEXT',desc='Insert a label into a queue',type='protos']
--

A single label can be inserted into a queue by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkQueueInsertDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:queue is the queue into which a debug label will be inserted.
  * pname:pLabelInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT structure specifying the parameters of the
    label to insert.

[[debugging-command-buffer-labels]]
=== Command Buffer Labels

Typical Vulkan applications will submit many command buffers in each frame,
with each command buffer containing a large number of individual commands.
Being able to logically annotate regions of command buffers that belong
together as well as hierarchically subdivide the frame is important to a
developer's ability to navigate the commands viewed holistically.

To identify the beginning of a debug label region in a command buffer,
flink:vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT can: be used as defined below.

To indicate the end of a debug label region in a command buffer,
flink:vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT can: be used.

To insert a single command buffer debug label inside of a command buffer,
flink:vkCmdInsertDebugUtilsLabelEXT can: be used as defined below.

[open,refpage='vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT',desc='Open a command buffer debug label region',type='protos']
--

A command buffer debug label region can be opened by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:pLabelInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT structure specifying the parameters of the
    label region to open.

include::../validity/protos/vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

[open,refpage='vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT',desc='Close a command buffer label region',type='protos']
--

A command buffer label region can be closed by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.

An application may: open a debug label region in one command buffer and
close it in another, or otherwise split debug label regions across multiple
command buffers or multiple queue submissions.
When viewed from the linear series of submissions to a single queue, the
calls to flink:vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT and
flink:vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT must: be matched and balanced.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT-commandBuffer-01912]]
    There must: be an outstanding fname:vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT command
    prior to the fname:vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT on the queue that
    pname:commandBuffer is submitted to
  * [[VUID-vkCmdEndDebugUtilsLabelEXT-commandBuffer-01913]]
    If pname:commandBuffer is a secondary command buffer, there must: be an
    outstanding fname:vkCmdBeginDebugUtilsLabelEXT command recorded to

[[debugging-debug-messengers]]
=== Debug Messengers

With debug messengers, Vulkan allows an application to register arbitrary
number of callbacks with all the Vulkan components wishing to report debug
information.
An application defined callback function can: perform various tasks in
response to the received message; it can: log the information
to a file, can: cause a debug break point, or can: behave in any other way
desired.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Primary producers of callback messages are validation layers, notably
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers[
KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers] hosted on GitHub and distributed with
the https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home[Vulkan SDK].

Even when no validation layers are enabled, an application can: still
register callbacks (assuming `VK_EXT_debug_utils` extension is enabled). 
The Vulkan loader, other layers, and ICDs may: also be producers of callback
messages.
====

[open,refpage='VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT',desc='Opaque handle to a debug messenger object',type='structs']
--

A sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT is a messenger object that handles
filtering and passing along debug messages to a provided debug callback.

include::../api/handles/VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='vkCreateDebugUtilsMessengerEXT',desc='Create a debug messenger object',type='protos']
--

To create a debug messenger, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateDebugUtilsMessengerEXT.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance the messenger will be used with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo points to a slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT
    structure, which contains the callback pointer as well as defines the
    conditions under which this messenger will trigger the callback.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pMessenger points to a sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT in which the
    resulting debug messenger is returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateDebugUtilsMessengerEXT.txt[]

--

When an event of interest occurs, a debug messenger calls its
pname:pCreateInfo\->pname:pfnUserCallback with a debug message from the
producer of the event.
But the debug messenger must: filter out any debug messages that the
application's callback is not interested in based on the parameters in
sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT structure pointed by
pname:pCreateInfo, as described below.

[open,refpage='VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT',desc='Structure specifying parameters of a newly created debug messenger',type='structs']
--

The definition of sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT is:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:messageSeverity is a bitmask of
    elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT specifying which severities
    of debug messages an application is interested in.
  * pname:messageType is a bitmask of
    elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageTypeFlagBitsEXT specifying which types of debug
    messages an application is interested in.
  * pname:pfnUserCallback is a pointer to the application defined callback
    function, which will receive the debug messages.
  * pname:pUserData are arbitrary user data to be passed to the callback.

For each sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT that is created,
the pname:messageSeverity and pname:messageTypes creation parameters
determine whether pname:pfnUserCallback will be called in reaction to given
event of interest.
The implementation must: filter out following messages (i.e. must: not call
pname:pfnUserCallback) in all of the following cases:

  * Bitwise AND of the messages's internal
    elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT state with the
    pname:messageSeverity the slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT object was
    created with results in 0.
  * Bitwise AND of the messages's internal
    elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageTypeFlagsEXT state with the pname:messageType
    the slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT object was created with results in 0.

The callback will be called directly from the component that produced the
message, unless some other layer intercepts the calls for its own purposes
(e.g. filter them in a different way, log to a system error log, etc.).

A callback must: always be called from the same thread as the originating
Vulkan call.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
An application can: receive multiple callbacks if multiple
sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT objects are created.
A callback may: be called from multiple threads simultaneously if the
application is making Vulkan calls from multiple threads.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT-pfnUserCallback-01914]]

--

Bits that can: be set in
slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT::pname:messageSeverity, specifying
message severities desired by the callback, are:

include::../api/enums/VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT.txt[]

  * ename:VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_SEVERITY_VERBOSE_BIT_EXT specifies the most
    verbose message severity, including messages that are more likely to be
    unhelpful when debugging an application.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_SEVERITY_INFO_BIT_EXT specifies an
    informational message such as resource details that might be handy when
    debugging an application.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_SEVERITY_WARNING_BIT_EXT specifies severity
    of messages reporting an use of Vulkan that the producer suspects to be
    a potential application bug.
    Such cases may: not be immediately harmful, such as a fragment shader
    outputting to a location with no attachment.
    Other cases may: point to a behavior that is almost certainly bad when
    unintended, such as reading an undefined value from an image whose
    memory have not yet been written or cleared.
    In general, if you see a warning, but you know that the behavior is
    intended/desired, then simply ignore the warning.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_SEVERITY_ERROR_BIT_EXT specifies severity
    of messages reporting an use of Vulkan that is almost certainly an
    invalid use of Vulkan, which would cause undefined behavior.

--

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The values of ename:VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT are sorted
with increasing severity.
The higher the flag value, the more severe the message.
This allows an application to use relation operators on the
ename:VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT values.

For example:

[source,c++]
----------------------------------------
    if (messageSeverity >= VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_SEVERITY_WARNING_BIT_EXT) {
        // Do something for warnings and errors
    }
----------------------------------------

In addition, space has been reserved between the existing enumerants to
allow future addition of new severities.

    type that reports on events about validation against the Vulkan
    specification, which may: indicate an invalid Vulkan use.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_UTILS_MESSAGE_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_BIT_EXT specifies a
    message type that reports potentially non-optimal use of Vulkan, e.g.
    using flink:vkCmdClearColorImage in situation where setting
    slink:VkAttachmentDescription::pname:loadOp to
    ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR would have sufficed.

  * pname:messageSeverity is a elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT
    that specifies the severity of the received message.
  * pname:messageType is a bitmask of
    elink:VkDebugUtilsMessageTypeFlagBitsEXT that specifies the type(s) of
    the received message.

    slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT structure that contains all
    the related data of the received message.
  * pname:pUserData are the user data provided when the
    slink:VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT was created.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
In accordance with the <<boilerplate-platform-specific-calling-conventions>>
section, the user defined callback function prototype to be used with
pname:pfnUserCallback is of the form:

[source,c]
----------------------------------------
    VKAPI_ATTR VkBool32 VKAPI_CALL yourName(
        VkDebugUtilsMessageSeverityFlagBitsEXT         messageSeverity,
        VkDebugUtilsMessageTypeFlagsEXT                messageType,
        const VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT*    pCallbackData,
        void*                                          pUserData);
----------------------------------------
====

The callback must: not call flink:vkDestroyDebugUtilsMessengerEXT on a
messenger object that triggered this callback.

The callback returns a basetype:VkBool32, which is interpreted in a
layer-specified manner.
The application should: always return ename:VK_FALSE.
The ename:VK_TRUE value is reserved for use in layer development.

The ownership of the memory pointed to by pname:pCallbackData is temporarily
released to the application for the duration of the callback.
When the callback returns, it is reaquired by the implementation, which may:
then modify or free the memory.

The definition of sname:VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT is:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:pMessageIdName is a null-terminated string that identifies the
    particular message ID that is associated with the provided message.
    If the message corresponds to a validation layer message, then this
    string may: contain the portion of the Vulkan specification that is
    believed to have been violated.
  * pname:messageIdNumber is the ID number of the triggering message.
    If the message corresponds to a validation layer message, then this
    number is related to the internal number associated with the message
    being triggered.
  * pname:pMessage is a null-terminated string detailing the trigger
    conditions.
  * pname:queueLabelCount is a count of items contained in the
    pname:pQueueLabels array.
  * pname:pQueueLabels is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT active in the current sname:VkQueue at the
    time the callback was triggered.
    Refer to <<debugging-queue-labels,Queue Labels>> for more information.
  * pname:cmdBufLabelCount is a count of items contained in the
    pname:pCmdBufLabels array.
  * pname:pCmdBufLabels is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDebugUtilsLabelEXT active in the current sname:VkCommandBuffer

    Refer to <<debugging-command-buffer-labels, Command Buffer Labels>> for
    more information.
  * pname:objectCount is a count of items contained in the pname:pObjects
    array.
  * pname:pObjects is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT objects related to the detected
    issue.
    The array is roughly in order of importance, but the 0th element is
    always guaranteed to be the most important object for this message.

Since adding queue and command buffer labels behaves like pushing and
popping onto a stack, the order of both pname:pQueueLabels and
pname:pCmdBufLabels is based on the order the labels were defined.
The consequence is that the first label in either pname:pQueueLabels or
pname:pCmdBufLabels will be the first defined (and therefore the oldest),
while the last label in each list will be the most recent.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
pname:pQueueLabels will only be non-`NULL` if one of the objects in
pname:pObjects is related directly to a defined sname:VkQueue that has had
one or more labels associated with it.

Likewise, pname:pCmdBufLabels will only be non-`NULL` if one of the objects in
pname:pObjects is related directly to a defined sname:VkCommandBuffer that
has had one or more labels associated with it.
Additionally, while command buffer labels allow for beginning and ending
across different command buffers, the debug messaging framework cannot:
guarantee that labels in pname:pCmdBufLables will contain those defined
outside of the associated command buffer.
This is partially due to the fact that the association of one command buffer
with another may not have been defined at the time the debug message is
triggered.
