When an application presents a swapchain image with dimensions different
than those of the target surface, different behavior is possible on
different platforms per their respective specifications:

  * Presentation fails and ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned
  * Scaling is done and ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR is
    returned
  * Unspecified scaling using an arbitrary combination of stretching,
    centering and/or clipping.

Applications can: define specific behavior when creating a swapchain by
including the sname:VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT structure in the
pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure.

The sname:VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:scalingBehavior is `0` or the scaling method to use when the
    dimensions of the surface and swapchain images differ.
  * pname:presentGravityX is `0` or the x-axis direction in which swapchain
    image pixels gravitate relative to the surface when
    pname:scalingBehavior does not result in a one-to-one pixel mapping
    between the scaled swapchain image and the surface.
  * pname:presentGravityY is `0` or the y-axis direction in which swapchain
    image pixels gravitate relative to the surface when
    pname:scalingBehavior does not result in a one-to-one pixel mapping
    between the scaled swapchain image and the surface.

If pname:scalingBehavior is `0`, the result of presenting a swapchain image
with dimensions that do not match the surface dimensions is implementation
and platform-dependent.
If pname:presentGravityX or pname:presentGravityY are `0`, the presentation
gravity must: match that defined by the native platform surface on platforms
which define surface gravity.
