The sname:VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR.adoc[]

ifdef::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT.adoc[]
endif::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:swapchainCount is the number of swapchains being presented to by
    this command.
  * pname:pFences is a list of fences with pname:swapchainCount entries.
    Each entry must: be dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE or the handle of a fence to
    signal when the relevant operations on the associated swapchain have
    completed.

The set of _queue operations_ defined by queuing an image for presentation,
as well as operations performed by the presentation engine, access the
payloads of objects associated with the presentation operation.
The associated objects include:

  * The swapchain image, its implicitly bound memory, and any other
    resources bound to that memory.
  * The wait semaphores specified when queuing the image for presentation.

include::{chapters}/VK_KHR_swapchain/common_present_fence.adoc[]

The application can: destroy the wait semaphores associated with a given
presentation operation when at least one of the associated fences is
signaled, and can: destroy the swapchain when the fences associated with all
past presentation requests referring to that swapchain have signaled.

Fences associated with presentations to the same swapchain on the same
slink:VkQueue must: be signaled in the same order as the present operations.

To specify a fence for each swapchain in a present operation, include the
sname:VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR structure in the pname:pNext chain of
the slink:VkPresentInfoKHR structure.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-07757]]
    pname:swapchainCount must: be equal to
    slink:VkPresentInfoKHR::pname:swapchainCount
  * [[VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07758]]
    Each element of pname:pFences that is not dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE must: be
    unsignaled
  * [[VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07759]]
    Each element of pname:pFences that is not dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE must: not
    be associated with any other queue command that has not yet completed
    execution on that queue
