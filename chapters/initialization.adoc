= Initialization

Before using Vulkan, an application must: initialize it by loading the
Vulkan commands, and creating a sname:VkInstance object.


[[initialization-functionpointers]]
== Command Function Pointers

Vulkan commands are not necessarily exposed by static linking on a platform.
Commands to query function pointers for Vulkan commands are described below.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When extensions are <<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> or
otherwise incorporated into another extension or Vulkan core version,
command <<extendingvulkan-compatibility-aliases,aliases>> may be included.
Whilst the behavior of each command alias is identical, the behavior of
retrieving each alias's function pointer is not.
A function pointer for a given alias can only be retrieved if the extension
or version that introduced that alias is supported and enabled, irrespective
of whether any other alias is available.

Function pointers for all Vulkan commands can: be obtained with the command:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetInstanceProcAddr.adoc[]

  * pname:instance is the instance that the function pointer will be
    compatible with, or `NULL` for commands not dependent on any instance.
  * pname:pName is the name of the command to obtain.

fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr itself is obtained in a platform- and loader-
specific manner.
Typically, the loader library will export this command as a function symbol,
so applications can: link against the loader library, or load it dynamically
and look up the symbol using platform-specific APIs.

The table below defines the various use cases for
fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr and expected return value ("`fp`" is "`function
pointer`") for each case.
A valid returned function pointer ("`fp`") must: not be `NULL`.

The returned function pointer is of type tlink:PFN_vkVoidFunction, and must:
be cast to the type of the command being queried before use.

dispatch code that calls a different real implementation for different

avoided by obtaining device-specific function pointers for any commands that

=== Extending Physical Device Core Functionality

New core physical-device-level functionality can: be used when the
physical-device version is greater than or equal to the version of Vulkan
that added the new functionality.
The Vulkan version supported by a physical device can: be obtained by
calling flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties.

=== Extending Physical Device From Device Extensions

When the `apiext:VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` extension is
enabled,
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
or when both the instance and the physical-device versions are at least 1.1,
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
physical-device-level functionality of a device extension can: be used with
a physical device if the corresponding extension is enumerated by
flink:vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties for that physical device, even
before a logical device has been created.

To obtain a function pointer for a physical-device-level command from a
device extension, an application can: use flink:vkGetInstanceProcAddr.
This function pointer may: point to dispatch code, which calls a different
real implementation for different sname:VkPhysicalDevice objects.
Applications must: not use a slink:VkPhysicalDevice in any command added by
an extension or core version that is not supported by that physical device.

Device extensions may: define structures that can: be added to the
ptext:pNext chain of physical-device-level commands.

[[initialization-instances]]
== Instances

[open,refpage='VkInstance',desc='Opaque handle to an instance object',type='handles']
--
There is no global state in Vulkan and all per-application state is stored
in a sname:VkInstance object.
Creating a sname:VkInstance object initializes the Vulkan library and allows
the application to pass information about itself to the implementation.

Instances are represented by sname:VkInstance handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkInstance.adoc[]
--

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
[open,refpage='vkEnumerateInstanceVersion',desc='Query instance-level version before instance creation',type='protos']
--
To query the version of instance-level functionality supported by the
implementation, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkEnumerateInstanceVersion.adoc[]

  * pname:pApiVersion is a pointer to a code:uint32_t, which is the version
    of Vulkan supported by instance-level functionality, encoded as
    described in <<extendingvulkan-coreversions-versionnumbers>>.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The intended behaviour of flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion is that an
implementation should: not need to perform memory allocations and should:
unconditionally return ename:VK_SUCCESS.
The loader, and any enabled layers, may: return
ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY in the case of a failed memory allocation.
====

include::{generated}/validity/protos/vkEnumerateInstanceVersion.adoc[]
--
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]

[open,refpage='vkCreateInstance',desc='Create a new Vulkan instance',type='protos']
--
To create an instance object, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateInstance.adoc[]

  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkInstanceCreateInfo structure
    controlling creation of the instance.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pInstance points a slink:VkInstance handle in which the resulting
    instance is returned.

fname:vkCreateInstance verifies that the requested layers exist.
If not, fname:vkCreateInstance will return ename:VK_ERROR_LAYER_NOT_PRESENT.
Next fname:vkCreateInstance verifies that the requested extensions are
supported (e.g. in the implementation or in any enabled instance layer) and
if any requested extension is not supported, fname:vkCreateInstance must:
return ename:VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT.
After verifying and enabling the instance layers and extensions the
sname:VkInstance object is created and returned to the application.
If a requested extension is only supported by a layer, both the layer and
the extension need to be specified at fname:vkCreateInstance time for the
creation to succeed.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Because Vulkan 1.0 implementations may: fail with
ename:VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER, applications should: determine the
version of Vulkan available before calling flink:vkCreateInstance.
If the flink:vkGetInstanceProcAddr returns `NULL` for
flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion, it is a Vulkan 1.0 implementation.
Otherwise, the application can: call flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion to
determine the version of Vulkan.
====

As long as the instance supports at least Vulkan 1.1, an application can:
use different versions of Vulkan with an instance than it does with a device
or physical device.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The Khronos validation layers will treat pname:apiVersion as the highest API
version the application targets, and will validate API usage against the
minimum of that version and the implementation version (instance or device,
depending on context).
If an application tries to use functionality from a greater version than
this, a validation error will be triggered.

For example, if the instance supports Vulkan 1.1 and three physical devices
support Vulkan 1.0, Vulkan 1.1, and Vulkan 1.2, respectively, and if the
application sets pname:apiVersion to 1.2, the application can: use the
following versions of Vulkan:

  * Vulkan 1.0 can: be used with the instance and with all physical devices.
  * Vulkan 1.1 can: be used with the instance and with the physical devices
    that support Vulkan 1.1 and Vulkan 1.2.
  * Vulkan 1.2 can: be used with the physical device that supports Vulkan
    1.2.

If we modify the above example so that the application sets pname:apiVersion
to 1.1, then the application must: not use Vulkan 1.2 functionality on the
physical device that supports Vulkan 1.2.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Providing a `NULL` slink:VkInstanceCreateInfo::pname:pApplicationInfo or
providing an pname:apiVersion of 0 is equivalent to providing an
pname:apiVersion of `VK_MAKE_API_VERSION(0,1,0,0)`.
