== Micromaps

_Acceleration structures_ store and organize geometry for ray tracing, but
in some cases it is beneficial to include some information within the
geometry, particularly for triangles.
A _micromap_ organizes this data around a map of values corresponding to
subdivided microtriangles which can be added to a triangle geometry when
building a _bottom level acceleration structure_.

An _opacity micromap_ is a type of micromap which stores information to
control intersection opacity as described in <<ray-opacity-micromap,Ray
Opacity Micromap>>.

A micromap is considered to be constructed if a <<micromap-building,micromap
build command>> or <<micromap-copying,copy command>> has been executed with
the given acceleration structure as the destination.

=== Building Micromaps

:refpage: vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT

To build micromaps call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:infoCount is the number of micromaps to build.
    It specifies the number of the pname:pInfos structures that must: be
    provided.
  * pname:pInfos is a pointer to an array of pname:infoCount
    slink:VkMicromapBuildInfoEXT structures defining the data used to build
    each micromap.

The fname:vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT command provides the ability to initiate
multiple micromaps builds, however there is no ordering or synchronization
implied between any of the individual micromap builds.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
This means that there cannot: be any memory aliasing between any micromap
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds.

The sname:VkMicromapBuildInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkMicromapBuildInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:type is a elink:VkMicromapTypeEXT value specifying the type of
    micromap being built.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkBuildMicromapFlagBitsEXT specifying
    additional parameters of the micromap.
  * pname:mode is a elink:VkBuildMicromapModeEXT value specifying the type
    of operation to perform.
  * pname:dstMicromap is a pointer to the target micromap for the build.
  * pname:usageCountsCount specifies the number of usage counts structures
    that will be used to determine the size of this micromap.
  * pname:pUsageCounts is a pointer to an array of slink:VkMicromapUsageEXT
    structures.
  * pname:ppUsageCounts is a pointer to an array of pointers to
    slink:VkMicromapUsageEXT structures.
  * pname:data is the device or host address to memory which contains the
    data for the micromap.
  * pname:scratchData is the device or host address to memory that will be
    used as scratch memory for the build.
  * pname:triangleArray is the device or host address to memory containing
    the slink:VkMicromapTriangleEXT data
  * pname:triangleArrayStride is the stride in bytes between each element of
    pname:triangleArray

Only one of pname:pUsageCounts or pname:ppUsageCounts can: be a valid
pointer, the other must: be `NULL`.
The elements of the non-`NULL` array describe the total counts used to build
each micromap.
Each element contains a pname:count which is the number of micromap
triangles of that pname:format and pname:subdivisionLevel contained in the
micromap.
Multiple elements with the same pname:format and pname:subdivisionLevel are
allowed and the total count for that pname:format and pname:subdivisionLevel
is the sum of the pname:count for each element.



Each micromap triangle refers to one element in pname:triangleArray which
contains the pname:format and pname:subdivisionLevel for that particular
triangle as well as a pname:dataOffset in bytes which is the location
relative to pname:data where that triangle's micromap data begins.
The data at pname:triangleArray is laid out as a 4 byte unsigned integer for
the pname:dataOffset followed by a 2 byte unsigned integer for the
subdivision level then a 2 byte unsigned integer for the format.
In practice, compilers compile slink:VkMicromapTriangleEXT to match this
pattern.

The data at pname:data is packed as either one bit per element for
ename:VK_OPACITY_MICROMAP_FORMAT_2_STATE_EXT or two bits per element for
ename:VK_OPACITY_MICROMAP_FORMAT_4_STATE_EXT and is packed from LSB to MSB
in each byte.
The data at each index in those bytes is interpreted as discussed in
<<ray-opacity-micromap, Ray Opacity Micromap>>.

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
pname:pVersionData is a _pointer_ to an array of 2{times}ename:VK_UUID_SIZE
code:uint8_t values instead of two ename:VK_UUID_SIZE arrays as the expected
use case for this member is to be pointed at the header of a previously
serialized micromap (via flink:vkCmdCopyMicromapToMemoryEXT or
flink:vkCopyMicromapToMemoryEXT) that is loaded in memory.
Using arrays would necessitate extra memory copies of the UUIDs.

[[host-micromap]]
== Host Micromap Operations

Implementations are also required to provide host implementations of the
micromap operations if the <<features-micromapHostCommands,
pname:micromapHostCommands>> feature is enabled:

  * flink:vkBuildMicromapsEXT corresponding to flink:vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT
  * flink:vkCopyMicromapEXT corresponding to flink:vkCmdCopyMicromapEXT
  * flink:vkCopyMicromapToMemoryEXT corresponding to
    flink:vkCmdCopyMicromapToMemoryEXT
  * flink:vkCopyMemoryToMicromapEXT corresponding to
    flink:vkCmdCopyMemoryToMicromapEXT
  * flink:vkWriteMicromapsPropertiesEXT corresponding to
    flink:vkCmdWriteMicromapsPropertiesEXT

These commands are functionally equivalent to their device counterparts,
except that they are executed on the host timeline, rather than being
enqueued into command buffers.

All micromaps used by the host commands must: be bound to host-visible
memory, and all input data for micromap builds must: be referenced using
host addresses instead of device addresses.
Applications are not required to map micromap memory when using the host
commands.


[NOTE]
.Note
====
The flink:vkBuildMicromapsEXT and flink:vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT may: use
different algorithms, and thus are not required to produce identical
structures.

Apart from these details, the host and device operations are
interchangeable.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For efficient execution, micromaps manipulated using these commands should
always be bound to host cached memory, as the implementation may need to
repeatedly read and write this memory during the execution of the command.

To build micromaps on the host, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkBuildMicromapsEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the sname:VkDevice for which the micromaps are being
    built.
  * pname:deferredOperation is an optional slink:VkDeferredOperationKHR to
    <<deferred-host-operations-requesting, request deferral>> for this
    command.
  * pname:infoCount is the number of micromaps to build.
    It specifies the number of the pname:pInfos that must: be provided.
  * pname:pInfos is a pointer to an array of pname:infoCount
    slink:VkMicromapBuildInfoEXT structures defining the geometry used to
    build each micromap.

This command fulfills the same task as flink:vkCmdBuildMicromapsEXT but is
executed by the host.

The fname:vkBuildMicromapsEXT command provides the ability to initiate
multiple micromaps builds, however there is no ordering or synchronization
implied between any of the individual micromap builds.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
This means that there cannot: be any memory aliasing between any micromap
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds.
