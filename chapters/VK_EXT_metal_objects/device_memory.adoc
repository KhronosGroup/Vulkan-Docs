=== Metal Objects

A Vulkan implementation that is layered on top of Metal on Apple device
platform, and implements the `apiext:VK_EXT_metal_objects` extension,
supports the ability to import and export the underlying Metal objects
associated with specific Vulkan objects.

The underlying Metal objects associated with certain Vulkan objects can be
exported from those Vulkan objects using the pname:pNext chain of the
slink:VkExportMetalObjectsInfoEXT parameter of the
flink:vkExportMetalObjectsEXT command.

An slink:VkDeviceMemory object can be allocated on an existing
code:MTLBuffer object, by including the code:MTLBuffer object in a
slink:VkImportMetalBufferInfoEXT structure in the pname:pNext chain of the
slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure in the flink:vkAllocateMemory command.

A new slink:VkImage object can be created on an existing code:IOSurface
object, or one or more existing Metal code:MTLTexture objects, by including
those Metal objects in either slink:VkImportMetalIOSurfaceInfoEXT or
slink:VkImportMetalTextureInfoEXT structures in the pname:pNext chain of the
slink:VkImageCreateInfo structure in the flink:vkCreateImage command.

[open,refpage='VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT',desc='Structure that identifies the Metal objects that can be exported from Vulkan objects',type='structs']
--
To export Metal objects from Vulkan objects, the app must: first indicate
the intention to do so during the creation of the Vulkan object, by
including one or more slink:VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT structures in
the pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkInstanceCreateInfo,
slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo, slink:VkImageCreateInfo,
slink:VkImageViewCreateInfo, slink:VkBufferViewCreateInfo,
slink:VkSemaphoreCreateInfo, or slink:VkEventCreateInfo, in the
corresponding Vulkan object creation command.

The sname:VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this

    be exported from the Vulkan object.
