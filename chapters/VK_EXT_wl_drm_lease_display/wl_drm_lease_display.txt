To acquire permission to directly access a display in Vulkan from a Wayland
compositor, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkAcquireWaylandDrmLeaseDisplayEXT.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device the display is on.
  * pname:display A code:wl_display associated with the Wayland compositor that
    the application wishes to acquire the display(s) from.
  * pname:leaseDevice A wp_drm_lease_device_v1 connected to the Wayland compositor
    that associated with the connectors.
  * pname:pConnectorCount The number of valid pointers in the pname:pConnectors
    array.
  * pname:pConnectors Array of slink:VkWaylandDrmLeaseConnectorEXT to be acquired.

All permissions necessary to control the display are granted to the Vulkan
instance associated with pname:physicalDevice until the display is released, the
Wayland connection specified by pname:display is terminated, or the compositor
revokes the lease.
If the Wayland server declines to grant the lease or the granted lease does not
include the requested connectors, the call must: return the error code
ename:VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED.
If the Wayland server later revokes the lease, requests using the
acquired slink:VkDisplayKHR resources must: fail with
ename:VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR.

The sname:VkWaylandDrmLeaseConnectorEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkWaylandDrmLeaseConnectorEXT.txt[]

  * pname:pConnector A Wayland wp_drm_lease_connector_v1 to include in the
    lease.
  * pname:pDisplay The corresponding slink:VkDisplayKHR handle will be
    returned here.

The implementation will make a best-effort attempt to match each
slink:VkDisplayKHR acquired from the Wayland compositor to the appropriate
pname:pConnectorIn. If no match is found or the result would be ambiguous, the
lease is terminated, and flink:vkAcquireWaylandDrmLeaseDisplayEXT must: return
ename:VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED.
