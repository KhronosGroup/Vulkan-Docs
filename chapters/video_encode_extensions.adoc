== Video Encode Operations

Before the application can start recording Vulkan command buffers for the
Video Encode Operations, it must: do the following, beforehand:

  . Ensure that the implementation can encode the Video Content by querying
    the supported codec operations and profiles using
    flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties2.
  . By using flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoFormatPropertiesKHR and providing
    one or more video profiles, choose the Vulkan formats supported by the
    implementation.
    The formats for <<encode-input-picture,input>> and
    <<reference-picture,reference>> pictures must: be queried and chosen
    separately.
    Refer to the section on
    <<supported-video-input-output-dpb-formats-enumeration,enumeration of
    supported video formats>>.
  . Before creating an image to be used as a video picture resource, obtain
    the supported image creation parameters by querying with
    flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2 and
    flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 using one of the
    reported formats and adding slink:VkVideoProfileListInfoKHR to the
    pname:pNext chain of slink:VkFormatProperties2.
    When querying the parameters with
    flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 for images targeting
    <<encode-input-picture,input>> and <<reference-picture,reference (DPB)>>
    pictures, the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceImageFormatInfo2::pname:usage field
    should contain ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_BIT_KHR and
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_VIDEO_ENCODE_DPB_BIT_KHR, respectively.
  . Create none, some, or all of the required <<VkImage,images>> for the
    <<encode-input-picture,input>> and <<reference-picture,reference>>
    pictures.
    More Video Picture Resources can: be created at some later point if
    needed while processing the content to be encoded.
    Also, if the size of the picture to be encoded is expected to change,
    the images can: be created based on the maximum expected content size.
  . Create the <<video-session,video session>> to be used for video encode
    operations.
    Before creating the Encode Video Session, the encode capabilities
    should: be queried with flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR to
    obtain the limits of the parameters allowed by the implementation for a
    particular codec profile.
  . Bind memory resources with the encode video session by calling
    flink:vkBindVideoSessionMemoryKHR.
    The video session cannot: be used until memory resources are allocated
    and bound to it.
    In order to determine the required memory sizes and heap types of the
    device memory allocations, flink:vkGetVideoSessionMemoryRequirementsKHR
    should: be called.
  . Create one or more <<video-session-parameters-introduction,Session
    Parameter objects>> for use across command buffer recording operations,
    if required by the codec extension in use.
    These objects must: be created against a <<video-session,video session>>
    with the parameters required by the codec.
    Each <<video-session-parameters-introduction,Session Parameter object>>
    created is a child object of the associated <<video-session, Session
    object>> and cannot: be bound in the command buffer with any other
    <<video-session,Session Object>>.


The recording of Video Encode Commands against a Vulkan Command Buffer
consists of the following sequence:

  . flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR starts the recording of one or more Video
    Encode operations in the command buffer.
    For each Video Encode Command operation, a Video Session must: be bound
    to the command buffer within this command.
    This command establishes a Vulkan Video Encode Context that consists of
    the bound Video Session Object, Session Parameters Object, and the
    required Video Picture Resources.
    The established Video Encode Context is in effect until the
    flink:vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR command is recorded.
    If more Video Encode operations are to be required after the
    flink:vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR command, another Video Encode Context can:
    be started with the flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR command.
  . flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR specifies one or more frames to be encoded.
    The slink:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR parameters, and the codec extension
    structures chained to this, specify the details of the encode operation.
  . flink:vkCmdControlVideoCodingKHR records operations against the encoded
    data, encoding device, or the Video Session state.
  . flink:vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR signals the end of the recording of the
    Vulkan Video Encode Context, as established by
    flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR.

In addition to the above, the following commands can: be recorded between
flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR and flink:vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR:

  * Query operations
  * Global Memory Barriers
  * Buffer Memory Barriers
  * Image Memory Barriers (these must: be used to transition the Video
    Picture Resources to the proper
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_KHR and
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_DPB_KHR layouts).
  * Pipeline Barriers
  * Events
  * Timestamps
  * Device Groups (device mask)

The following Video Encode related commands must: be recorded *outside* the
Vulkan Video Encode Context established with the
flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR and flink:vkCmdEndVideoCodingKHR commands:

  * Sparse Memory Binding
  * Copy Commands
  * Clear Commands


=== Capabilities

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR',desc='Structure specifying encode capabilities',type='structs']
--
When calling flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR with
pname:pVideoProfile->videoCodecOperation specified as one of the encode
operation bits, the slink:VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR structure must: be
included in the pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR
structure to retrieve capabilities specific to video encoding.

The sname:VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkVideoEncodeCapabilityFlagBitsKHR
    describing supported encoding features.
  * pname:rateControlModes is a bitmask of
    elink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlModeFlagBitsKHR describing supported rate
    control modes.
    All implementations must: support
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:rateControlLayerCount reports the maximum number of rate control
    layers supported.
    Implementations must: report at least 1.
  * pname:qualityLevelCount is the number of discrete quality levels
    supported.
    Implementations must: report at least 1.
  * pname:inputImageDataFillAlignment reports alignment of data that should
    be filled in the input image horizontally and vertically in pixels
    before encode operations are performed on the input image.

The input content and encode resolution (specified in
slink:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR::pname:codedExtent) may not be aligned with the
codec-specific coding block size.
For example, the input content may be 1920x1080 and the coding block size
may be 16x16 pixel blocks.
In this example, the content is horizontally aligned with the coding block
size, but not vertically aligned with the coding block size.
Encoding of the last row of blocks may be impacted by contents of the input
image in pixel rows 1081 to 1088 (the next vertical alignment with the
coding block size).
In general, to ensure efficient encoding for the last row/column of blocks,
and/or to ensure consistent encoding results between repeated encoding of
the same input content, these extra pixel rows/columns should be filled to
known values up to the coding block size alignment before encoding
operations are performed.
Some implementations support performing auto-fill of unaligned pixels beyond
a specific alignment, which is reported in
pname:inputImageDataFillAlignment.
For example, if an implementation reports 1x1 in
pname:inputImageDataFillAlignment, then the implementation will perform
auto-fill for any unaligned pixels beyond the encode resolution up to the
next coding block size.
For a coding block size of 16x16, if the implementation reports 16x16 in
pname:inputImageDataFillAlignment, then it is the application's
responsibility to fill any unaligned pixels, if desired.
If not, it may impact the encoding efficiency, but it will not affect the
validity of the generated bitstream.
If the implementation reports 8x8 in pname:inputImageDataFillAlignment, then
for the 1920x1080 example, since the content is aligned to 8 pixels
vertically, the implementation will auto-fill pixel rows 1081 to 1088 (up to
the 16x16 coding block size in the example).
The auto-fill value(s) are implementation-specific.
The auto-fill value(s) are not written to the input image memory, but are
used as part of the encoding operation on the input image.

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
    A codec-specific extension structure must: be chained to specify what
    bitstream unit to generate with this encode operation.

    as reported by the implementation.
  * pname:dstBitstreamBufferMaxRange is the maximum size of the
    pname:dstBitstreamBuffer that can be used while the encoded bitstream
    output is produced.
    pname:dstBitstreamBufferMaxRange's value must: be aligned to
    slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR::pname:minBitstreamBufferSizeAlignment, as
    reported by the implementation.
  * pname:srcPictureResource is the Picture Resource of the
    <<encode-input-picture,Input Picture>> to be encoded by the operation.
  * pname:pSetupReferenceSlot is a pointer to a
    slink:VkVideoReferenceSlotInfoKHR structure used for generating a
    reconstructed reference slot and Picture Resource.
    pname:pSetupReferenceSlot->slotIndex specifies the slot index number to
    use as a target for producing the Reconstructed (DPB) data.
    pname:pSetupReferenceSlot must: be one of the entries provided in

    Pictures that will be used when this encoding operation is executing.
  * pname:pReferenceSlots is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkVideoReferenceSlotInfoKHR structures that will be used when this
    encoding operation is executing.
    Each entry in pname:pReferenceSlots must: be one of the entries provided
    in slink:VkVideoBeginCodingInfoKHR via the pname:pReferenceSlots within
    the flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR command that established the Vulkan
    Video Encode Context for this command.
  * pname:precedingExternallyEncodedBytes is the number of bytes externally
    encoded for insertion in the active video encode session overall
    bitstream prior to the bitstream that will be generated by the
    implementation for this instance of sname:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR.
    Valid when slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR::pname:rateControlMode
    is not ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
    The value provided is used to update the implementation's rate control
    algorithm for the rate control layer this instance of
    sname:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR belongs to, by accounting for the bitrate
    budget consumed by these externally encoded bytes.
    See slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR for additional information
    about encode rate control.

The coded size of the encode operation is specified in pname:codedExtent of
pname:srcPictureResource.

Multiple flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR commands may: be recorded within a Vulkan
Video Encode Context.
The execution of each flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR command will result in
generating codec-specific bitstream units.
These bitstream units are generated consecutively into the bitstream buffer
specified in pname:dstBitstreamBuffer of a sname:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR
structure within the flink:vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR command.
The produced bitstream is the sum of all these bitstream units, including
any padding between the bitstream units.
Any bitstream padding must: be filled with data compliant to the codec
standard so as not to cause any syntax errors during decoding of the
bitstream units with the padding included.
The range of the bitstream buffer written can: be queried via
<<queries-video-encode-bitstream-buffer-range, video encode bitstream buffer
range queries>>.

tlink:VkVideoEncodeFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is
currently reserved for future use.

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR',desc='Structure to set encode stream rate control parameters',type='structs']
--
The sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:rateControlMode is a elink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlModeFlagBitsKHR
    value specifying the encode stream rate control mode.
  * pname:layerCount specifies the number of rate control layers in the
    video encode stream.
  * pname:pLayerConfigs is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR structures specifying the
    rate control configurations of pname:layerCount rate control layers.

Including this structure in the pname:pNext chain of
slink:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR and including
ename:VK_VIDEO_CODING_CONTROL_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_BIT_KHR in
slink:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR::pname:flags will define stream rate
control settings for video encoding.

Additional structures providing codec-specific rate control parameters may:
need to be included in the pname:pNext chain of
sname:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR depending on the codec profile the bound
video session was created with and the parameters specified in
sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR (see <<video-session-control,Video
Session Control>>).

To ensure that the video session is properly initialized with stream-level
rate control settings, the application must: call
flink:vkCmdControlVideoCodingKHR with stream-level rate control settings at
least once in execution order before the first flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR
command that is executed after video session reset.
If not provided, default implementation-specific stream rate control
settings will be used.

Stream rate control settings can: also be re-initialized during an active
video encoding session.
The re-initialization takes effect whenever the
sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR structure is included in the
pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR structure in the
call to flink:vkCmdControlVideoCodingKHR, and only impacts
flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR operations that follow in execution order.

The sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
  * pname:averageBitrate is the average bitrate in bits/second.
    Valid when rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:maxBitrate is the peak bitrate in bits/second.
    Valid when rate control mode is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_VBR_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:frameRateNumerator is the numerator of the frame rate.
    Valid when rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:frameRateDenominator is the denominator of the frame rate.
    Valid when rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:virtualBufferSizeInMs is the leaky bucket model virtual buffer
    size in milliseconds, with respect to peak bitrate.
    Valid when rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.
    For example, virtual buffer size is (pname:virtualBufferSizeInMs {times}
    pname:maxBitrate / 1000).
  * pname:initialVirtualBufferSizeInMs is the initial occupancy in
    milliseconds of the virtual buffer in the leaky bucket model.
    Valid when the rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR.

A codec-specific structure specifying additional per-layer rate control
settings must: be chained to sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR.
If multiple rate control layers are enabled
(slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR::pname:layerCount is greater than 1),
then the chained codec-specific extension structure also identifies the
specific video coding layer its parent
sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR applies to.
If multiple rate control layers are enabled, the number of rate control
layers must: match the number of video coding layers.
The specification for an encode codec-specific extension would describe how
multiple video coding layers are enabled for the corresponding codec.

Per-layer rate control settings for all enabled rate control layers must: be
initialized or re-initialized whenever stream rate control settings are
provided via slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR.
This is done by specifying settings for all enabled rate control layers in
slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR::pname:pLayerConfigs.

Including this structure in the pname:pNext chain of
slink:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR and including
ename:VK_VIDEO_CODING_CONTROL_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_LAYER_BIT_KHR in
slink:VkVideoCodingControlInfoKHR::pname:flags will define stream rate
control settings for individual layers during video encoding.
This adjustment only impacts the specified layer without impacting the rate
control settings or implementation rate control algorithm behavior for any
other enabled rate control layers.
The adjustment takes effect whenever the corresponding
flink:vkCmdControlVideoCodingKHR is executed, and only impacts
flink:vkCmdEncodeVideoKHR operations pertaining to the corresponding video
coding layer that follow in execution order.

It is possible for an application to enable multiple video coding layers
(via codec-specific extensions to encoding operations) while only enabling a
single layer of rate control for the entire video stream.
To achieve this, pname:layerCount in slink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR
must: be set to 1, and the single sname:VkVideoEncodeRateControlLayerInfoKHR
provided in pname:pLayerConfigs would apply to all encoded segments of the
video stream, regardless of which codec-defined video coding layer they
belong to.
In this case, the implementation decides bitrate distribution across video
coding layers (if applicable to the specified stream rate control mode).
