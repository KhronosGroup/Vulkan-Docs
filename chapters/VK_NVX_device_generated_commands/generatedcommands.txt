= Device-Generated Commands

This chapter discusses the generation of command buffer content on the
device.
These principle steps are to be taken to generate commands on the device:

  * Make resource bindings accessible for the device via registering in a
    sname:VkObjectTableNVX.
  * Define via sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX the sequence of commands
    which should be generated.
  * Fill one or more sname:VkBuffer with the appropriate content that gets
    interpreted by sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX.
  * Reserve command space via flink:vkCmdReserveSpaceForCommandsNVX in a
    secondary sname:VkCommandBuffer where the generated commands should be
    recorded.
  * Generate the actual commands via flink:vkCmdProcessCommandsNVX passing
    all required data.

Execution of such generated commands can either be triggered directly with
the generation process, or by executing the secondary sname:VkCommandBuffer
that was chosen as optional target.
The latter allows re-using generated commands as well.
Similar to sname:VkDescriptorSet, special care should: be taken for the
lifetime of resources referenced in sname:VkObjectTableNVX, which may be
accessed at either generation or execution time.

flink:vkCmdProcessCommandsNVX executes in a separate logical pipeline from
either graphics or compute.
When generating commands into a secondary command buffer, the command
generation must: be explicitly synchronized against the secondary command
buffer's execution.
When not using a secondary command buffer, the command generation is
automatically synchronized against the command execution.

    sname:VkObjectTableNVX supports entries with
    ename:VK_OBJECT_ENTRY_USAGE_GRAPHICS_BIT_NVX bit set and
    sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX supports
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE.
