[[pipelines]]
= Pipelines

The following <<pipelines-block-diagram,figure>> shows a block diagram of
the Vulkan pipelines.
Some Vulkan commands specify geometric objects to be drawn or computational
work to be performed, while others specify state controlling how objects are
handled by the various pipeline stages, or control data transfer between
memory organized as images and buffers.
Commands are effectively sent through a processing pipeline, either a
_graphics pipeline_,
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing,VK_KHR_ray_tracing[]
a _ray tracing pipeline_,
endif::VK_NV_ray_tracing,VK_KHR_ray_tracing[]
or a _compute pipeline_.

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]
The graphics pipeline can be operated in two modes, as either _primitive
shading_ or _mesh shading_ pipeline.

*Primitive Shading*

endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]

The first stage of the <<pipelines-graphics,graphics pipeline>>
(<<drawing,Input Assembler>>) assembles vertices to form geometric
primitives such as points, lines, and triangles, based on a requested
primitive topology.
In the next stage (<<shaders-vertex,Vertex Shader>>) vertices can: be
transformed, computing positions and attributes for each vertex.
If <<tessellation,tessellation>> and/or <<geometry,geometry>> shaders are
supported, they can: then generate multiple primitives from a single input
primitive, possibly changing the primitive topology or generating additional
attribute data in the process.

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]
*Mesh Shading*

When using the <<mesh,_mesh shading_>> pipeline input primitives are not
assembled implicitly, but explicitly through the (<<shaders-mesh,Mesh
Shader>>).
The work on the mesh pipeline is initiated by the application
<<drawing-mesh-shading,drawing>> a set of mesh tasks.

If an optional (<<shaders-task,Task Shader>>) is active, each task triggers
the execution of a task shader workgroup that will generate a new set of
tasks upon completion.
Each of these spawned tasks, or each of the original dispatched tasks if no
task shader is present, triggers the execution of a mesh shader workgroup
that produces an output mesh with a variable-sized number of primitives
assembled from vertices stored in the output mesh.

*Common*
endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]

The final resulting primitives are <<vertexpostproc-clipping,clipped>> to a
clip volume in preparation for the next stage, <<primsrast,Rasterization>>.
The rasterizer produces a series of _fragments_ associated with a region of
the framebuffer, from a two-dimensional description of a point, line
segment, or triangle.
These fragments are processed by <<fragops,fragment operations>> to
determine whether generated values will be written to the framebuffer.
<<shaders-fragment, fragment shading>> determines the values to be written
to the framebuffer attachments.
Framebuffer operations then read and write the color and depth/stencil
attachments of the framebuffer for a given subpass of a <<renderpass,render
pass instance>>.
The attachments can: be used as input attachments in the fragment shader in
a later subpass of the same render pass.

The <<pipelines-compute,compute pipeline>> is a separate pipeline from the
graphics pipeline, which operates on one-, two-, or three-dimensional
workgroups which can: read from and write to buffer and image memory.

This ordering is meant only as a tool for describing Vulkan, not as a strict
rule of how Vulkan is implemented, and we present it only as a means to
organize the various operations of the pipelines.
Actual ordering guarantees between pipeline stages are explained in detail
in the <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, synchronization chapter>>.

Each pipeline is controlled by a monolithic object created from a
description of all of the shader stages and any relevant fixed-function
stages.
<<interfaces,Linking>> the whole pipeline together allows the optimization
of shaders based on their input/outputs and eliminates expensive draw time
state validation.

A pipeline object is bound to the current state using
flink:vkCmdBindPipeline.
Any pipeline object state that is specified as <<pipelines-dynamic-state,
dynamic>> is not applied to the current state when the pipeline object is
bound, but is instead set by dynamic state setting commands.

No state, including dynamic state, is inherited from one command buffer to
another.

== Compute Pipelines

Compute pipelines consist of a single static compute shader stage and the
pipeline layout.

The compute pipeline represents a compute shader and is created by calling
fname:vkCreateComputePipelines with pname:module and pname:pName selecting
an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point defines a valid
compute shader, in the slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure
contained within the slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structure.

[open,refpage='vkCreateComputePipelines',desc='Creates a new compute pipeline object',type='protos']

To create compute pipelines, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateComputePipelines.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the compute pipelines.
  * pname:pipelineCache is either dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, indicating that
    pipeline caching is disabled; or the handle of a valid
    <<pipelines-cache,pipeline cache>> object, in which case use of that
    cache is enabled for the duration of the command.
  * pname:createInfoCount is the length of the pname:pCreateInfos and
    pname:pPipelines arrays.
  * pname:pCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structures.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelines is a pointer to an array of slink:VkPipeline handles in
    which the resulting compute pipeline objects are returned.

=== Valid Combinations of Stages for Graphics Pipelines

ifdef::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]
The geometric primitive processing can either be handled on a per primitive
basis by the vertex, tessellation, and geometry shader stages, or on a per
mesh basis using task and mesh shader stages.
If the pipeline includes a mesh shader stage, it uses the mesh pipeline,
otherwise it uses the primitive pipeline.

If a task shader is omitted, the task shading stage is skipped.
endif::VK_NV_mesh_shader[]

If tessellation shader stages are omitted, the tessellation shading and
fixed-function stages of the pipeline are skipped.

If a geometry shader is omitted, the geometry shading stage is skipped.

If a fragment shader is omitted, fragment color outputs have undefined:
values, and the fragment depth value is unmodified.
This can: be useful for depth-only rendering.

Presence of a shader stage in a pipeline is indicated by including a valid
slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo with pname:module and pname:pName
selecting an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point is
valid for the stage specified by pname:stage.

Presence of some of the fixed-function stages in the pipeline is implicitly
derived from enabled shaders and provided state.
For example, the fixed-function tessellator is always present when the
pipeline has valid Tessellation Control and Tessellation Evaluation shaders.

=== Graphics Pipeline Shader Groups

Graphics pipelines can contain multiple shader groups that can be bound
individually.
Each shader group behaves as if it was a pipeline using the shader group's
state.
When the pipeline is bound by regular means, it behaves as if the state of
group `0` is active, use flink:vkCmdBindPipelineShaderGroupNV to bind an
invidual shader group.

The primary purpose of shader groups is allowing the device to bind
different pipeline state using <<device-generated-commands>>.

  * pname:pGroups is an array of slink:VkGraphicsShaderGroupCreateInfoNV
    values specifying which state of the original
    slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo each shader group overrides.
  * pname:pipelineCount is the number of elements in the pname:pPipelines
    array.
  * pname:pPipelines is an array of graphics sname:VkPipeline, which are
    referenced within the created pipeline, including all their shader
    groups.

When referencing shader groups by index, groups defined in the referenced
pipelines are treated as if they were defined as additional entries in
pname:pGroups.
They are appended in the order they appear in the pname:pPipelines array and

[[pipelines-multiple]]
== Multiple Pipeline Creation

Multiple pipelines can: be created simultaneously by passing an array of
slink:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo,
ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing[slink:VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[slink:VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoNV,]
or slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structures into the

ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesNV,]
and flink:vkCreateComputePipelines commands, respectively.
Applications can: group together similar pipelines to be created in a single
call, and implementations are encouraged to look for reuse opportunities
within a group-create.

When an application attempts to create many pipelines in a single command,
it is possible that some subset may: fail creation.
In that case, the corresponding entries in the pname:pPipelines output array
will be filled with dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values.
If any pipeline fails creation despite valid arguments (for example, due to
out of memory errors), the elink:VkResult code returned by
ftext:vkCreate*Pipelines will indicate why.
The implementation will attempt to create all pipelines, and only return
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values for those that actually failed.

ifdef::VK_EXT_pipeline_creation_cache_control[]
If creation fails for a pipeline that had
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_EARLY_RETURN_ON_FAILURE_BIT_EXT set, pipelines at
an index in the pname:pPipelines array greater than or equal to that of the
failing pipeline must: be set to dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE.
endif::VK_EXT_pipeline_creation_cache_control[]

[[pipelines-pipeline-derivatives]]
== Pipeline Derivatives

A pipeline derivative is a child pipeline created from a parent pipeline,
where the child and parent are expected to have much commonality.
The goal of derivative pipelines is that they be cheaper to create using the
parent as a starting point, and that it be more efficient (on either host or
device) to switch/bind between children of the same parent.

A derivative pipeline is created by setting the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag in the
stext:Vk*PipelineCreateInfo structure.
If this is set, then exactly one of pname:basePipelineHandle or
pname:basePipelineIndex members of the structure must: have a valid
handle/index, and specifies the parent pipeline.
If pname:basePipelineHandle is used, the parent pipeline must: have already
been created.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, then the parent is being created in the
same command.
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE acts as the invalid handle for
pname:basePipelineHandle, and -1 is the invalid index for
pname:basePipelineIndex.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, the base pipeline must: appear earlier
in the array.
The base pipeline must: have been created with the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT flag set.


[[pipelines-cache]]
== Pipeline Cache

[open,refpage='VkPipelineCache',desc='Opaque handle to a pipeline cache object',type='handles']
--

Pipeline cache objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be
reused between pipelines and between runs of an application.
Reuse between pipelines is achieved by passing the same pipeline cache
object when creating multiple related pipelines.
Reuse across runs of an application is achieved by retrieving pipeline cache
contents in one run of an application, saving the contents, and using them
to preinitialize a pipeline cache on a subsequent run.
The contents of the pipeline cache objects are managed by the
implementation.
Applications can: manage the host memory consumed by a pipeline cache object
and control the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache object.

Pipeline cache objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineCache handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkPipelineCache.txt[]

To create pipeline cache objects, call:

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the pipeline cache
    object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo
    structure containing initial parameters for the pipeline cache object.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelineCache is a pointer to a slink:VkPipelineCache handle in
    which the resulting pipeline cache object is returned.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Applications can: track and manage the total host memory size of a pipeline
cache object using the pname:pAllocator.
Applications can: limit the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache
object in fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData.
Implementations should: not internally limit the total number of entries
added to a pipeline cache object or the total host memory consumed.

flink:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines
ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesKHR,]
ifdef::VK_NV_ray_tracing[flink:vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesNV,]
and flink:vkCreateComputePipelines commands.
If the pipeline cache passed into these commands is not
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, the implementation will query it for possible reuse
opportunities and update it with new content.
The use of the pipeline cache object in these commands is internally
synchronized, and the same pipeline cache object can: be used in multiple
threads simultaneously.

In human readable SPIR-V:

[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
OpDecorate %x SpecId 13 ; decorate .x component of WorkgroupSize with ID 13
OpDecorate %y SpecId 42 ; decorate .y component of WorkgroupSize with ID 42
OpDecorate %z SpecId 3  ; decorate .z component of WorkgroupSize with ID 3
OpDecorate %wgsize BuiltIn WorkgroupSize ; decorate WorkgroupSize onto constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 0 ; declare an unsigned 32-bit type
%uvec3 = OpTypeVector %i32 3 ; declare a 3 element vector type of unsigned 32-bit
%x = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .x component of WorkgroupSize
%y = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .y component of WorkgroupSize
%z = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .z component of WorkgroupSize
%wgsize = OpSpecConstantComposite %uvec3 %x %y %z ; declare WorkgroupSize
---------------------------------------------------

From the above we have three specialization constants, one for each of the
x, y & z elements of the WorkgroupSize vector.

Now to specialize the above via the specialization constants mechanism:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
const VkSpecializationMapEntry entries[] =
{
    {
        13,                             // constantID
        0 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    },
    {
        42,                             // constantID
        1 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    },
    {
        3,                              // constantID
        2 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    }
};

const uint32_t data[] = { 16, 8, 4 }; // our workgroup size is 16x8x4

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    3,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    3 * sizeof(uint32_t),               // dataSize
    data,                               // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

Then when calling flink:vkCreateComputePipelines, and passing the
sname:VkSpecializationInfo we defined as the pname:pSpecializationInfo
parameter of slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo, we will create a compute
pipeline with the runtime specified local workgroup size.

Another example would be that an application has a SPIR-V module that has
some platform-dependent constants they wish to use.

In human readable SPIR-V:

// [source,glsl]
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
OpDecorate %1 SpecId 0  ; decorate our signed 32-bit integer constant
OpDecorate %2 SpecId 12 ; decorate our 32-bit floating-point constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 1   ; declare a signed 32-bit type
%float = OpTypeFloat 32 ; declare a 32-bit floating-point type
%1 = OpSpecConstant %i32 -1 ; some signed 32-bit integer constant
%2 = OpSpecConstant %float 0.5 ; some 32-bit floating-point constant
---------------------------------------------------

From the above we have two specialization constants, one is a signed 32-bit
integer and the second is a 32-bit floating-point.

Now to specialize the above via the specialization constants mechanism:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
struct SpecializationData {
    int32_t data0;
    float data1;
};

const VkSpecializationMapEntry entries[] =
{
    {
        0,                                    // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data0),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data0)     // size
    },
    {
        12,                                   // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data1),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data1)     // size
    }
};

SpecializationData data;
data.data0 = -42;    // set the data for the 32-bit integer
data.data1 = 42.0f;  // set the data for the 32-bit floating-point

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    2,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    sizeof(data),                       // dataSize
    &data,                              // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

It is legal for a SPIR-V module with specializations to be compiled into a
pipeline where no specialization info was provided.
SPIR-V specialization constants contain default values such that if a
specialization is not provided, the default value will be used.
In the examples above, it would be valid for an application to only
specialize some of the specialization constants within the SPIR-V module,
and let the other constants use their default values encoded within the
OpSpecConstant declarations.


ifdef::VK_KHR_pipeline_library[]
[[pipeline-library]]
== Pipeline Libraries

A pipeline library is a special pipeline that was created using the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LIBRARY_BIT_KHR and cannot be bound, instead it
defines a set of pipeline state which can be linked into other pipelines.
ifdef::VK_KHR_ray_tracing[]
For ray tracing pipelines this includes shaders and shader groups.
endif::VK_KHR_ray_tracing[]
The application must: maintain the lifetime of pipeline libraries based on
the pipelines that link with it.
A pipeline library is considered in-use, as long as one of the linking
pipelines is in-use.

This linkage is achieved by using the following structure within the
appropriate creation mechanisms:

[open,refpage='VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR',desc='Structure specifying pipeline libraries to use when creating a pipeline',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:libraryCount is the number of pipeline libraries in
    pname:pLibraries.
  * pname:pLibraries is an array of pipeline libraries to use when creating
    a pipeline.

commands in the command buffer until a different pipeline is bound to the
bind point.

[[pipelines-dynamic-state]]
== Dynamic State

When a pipeline object is bound, any pipeline object state that is not
specified as dynamic is applied to the command buffer state.
Pipeline object state that is specified as dynamic is not applied to the
command buffer state at this time.
Instead, dynamic state can: be modified at any time and persists for the
lifetime of the command buffer, or until modified by another dynamic state
setting command or another pipeline bind.

When a pipeline object is bound, the following applies to each state
parameter:

  * If the state is not specified as dynamic in the new pipeline object,
    then that command buffer state is overwritten by the state in the new
    pipeline object.
    Before any draw or dispatch call with this pipeline there must: not have
    been any call to any of the corresponding dynamic state setting commands
    after this pipeline was bound
  * If the state is specified as dynamic in the new pipeline object, then
    that command buffer state is not disturbed.
    Before any draw or dispatch call with this pipeline there must: have
    been at least one call to each of the corresponding dynamic state
    setting commands since the command buffer recording was begun, or the
    last bound pipeline object with that state specified as static,
    whichever was the latter

Dynamic state that does not affect the result of operations can: be left
undefined:.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For example, if blending is disabled by the pipeline object state then the
dynamic color blend constants do not need to be specified in the command
buffer, even if this state is specified as dynamic in the pipeline object.
