[[renderpass]]
= Render Pass

[open,refpage='VkRenderPass',desc='Opaque handle to a render pass object',type='handles']
--

A _render pass_ represents a collection of attachments, subpasses, and
dependencies between the subpasses, and describes how the attachments are
used over the course of the subpasses.
The use of a render pass in a command buffer is a _render pass instance_.

Render passes are represented by sname:VkRenderPass handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkRenderPass.txt[]

--

An _attachment description_ describes the properties of an attachment
including its format, sample count, and how its contents are treated at the
beginning and end of each render pass instance.

[[renderpass-subpass]]
A _subpass_ represents a phase of rendering that reads and writes a subset
of the attachments in a render pass.
Rendering commands are recorded into a particular subpass of a render pass
instance.

A _subpass description_ describes the subset of attachments that is involved
in the execution of a subpass.
Each subpass can: read from some attachments as _input attachments_, write
to some as _color attachments_ or _depth/stencil attachments_,
ifdef::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]
perform _shader resolve operations_ to _color_attachments_ or
_depth/stencil_attachments_,
endif::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]
and perform _multisample resolve operations_ to _resolve attachments_.
A subpass description can: also include a set of _preserve attachments_,
which are attachments that are not read or written by the subpass but whose
contents must: be preserved throughout the subpass.

A subpass _uses an attachment_ if the attachment is a color, depth/stencil,
resolve,
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
depth/stencil resolve,
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
or input attachment for that subpass (as determined by the
pname:pColorAttachments, pname:pDepthStencilAttachment,
pname:pResolveAttachments,
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
slink:VkSubpassDescriptionDepthStencilResolve::pname:pDepthStencilResolveAttachment,
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve[]
and pname:pInputAttachments members of slink:VkSubpassDescription,
respectively).
A subpass does not use an attachment if that attachment is preserved by the
subpass.
The _first use of an attachment_ is in the lowest numbered subpass that uses
that attachment.
Similarly, the _last use of an attachment_ is in the highest numbered
subpass that uses that attachment.

The subpasses in a render pass all render to the same dimensions, and
fragments for pixel (x,y,layer) in one subpass can: only read attachment
contents written by previous subpasses at that same (x,y,layer) location.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
By describing a complete set of subpasses in advance, render passes provide
the implementation an opportunity to optimize the storage and transfer of
attachment data between subpasses.

In practice, this means that subpasses with a simple framebuffer-space
dependency may: be merged into a single tiled rendering pass, keeping the
attachment data on-chip for the duration of a render pass instance.
However, it is also quite common for a render pass to only contain a single
subpass.
====

_Subpass dependencies_ describe <<synchronization-dependencies, execution
and memory dependencies>> between subpasses.

A _subpass dependency chain_ is a sequence of subpass dependencies in a
render pass, where the source subpass of each subpass dependency (after the
first) equals the destination subpass of the previous dependency.

Execution of subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to
other subpasses, unless otherwise enforced by an execution dependency.
Each subpass only respects <<synchronization-submission-order, submission
order>> for commands recorded in the same subpass, and the
flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass and flink:vkCmdEndRenderPass commands that
delimit the render pass - commands within other subpasses are not included.
This affects most other <<synchronization-implicit, implicit ordering
guarantees>>.

A render pass describes the structure of subpasses and attachments
independent of any specific image views for the attachments.
The specific image views that will be used for the attachments, and their
dimensions, are specified in sname:VkFramebuffer objects.
Framebuffers are created with respect to a specific render pass that the
framebuffer is compatible with (see <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass
Compatibility>>).
Collectively, a render pass and a framebuffer define the complete render
target state for one or more subpasses as well as the algorithmic
dependencies between the subpasses.

The various pipeline stages of the drawing commands for a given subpass may:
execute concurrently and/or out of order, both within and across drawing
commands, whilst still respecting <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order,
pipeline order>>.
However for a given (x,y,layer,sample) sample location, certain per-sample
operations are performed in <<primrast-order,rasterization order>>.

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:subpassCount is zero or the number of subpasses in the render
    pass.
  * pname:pViewMasks is a pointer to an array of pname:subpassCount view
    masks, where each mask is a bitfield of view indices describing which
    views rendering is broadcast to in each subpass, when multiview is
    enabled.
    If pname:subpassCount is zero, each view mask is treated as zero.
  * pname:dependencyCount is zero or the number of dependencies in the
    render pass.
  * pname:pViewOffsets is a pointer to an array of pname:dependencyCount
    view offsets, one for each dependency.
    If pname:dependencyCount is zero, each dependency's view offset is
    treated as zero.
    Each view offset controls which views in the source subpass the views in
    the destination subpass depend on.
  * pname:correlationMaskCount is zero or the number of correlation masks.
  * pname:pCorrelationMasks is a pointer to an array of
    pname:correlationMaskCount view masks indicating sets of views that may:
    be more efficient to render concurrently.

When a subpass uses a non-zero view mask, _multiview_ functionality is
considered to be enabled.
Multiview is all-or-nothing for a render pass - that is, either all
subpasses must: have a non-zero view mask (though some subpasses may: have
only one view) or all must: be zero.
Multiview causes all drawing and clear commands in the subpass to behave as
if they were broadcast to each view, where a view is represented by one
layer of the framebuffer attachments.
All draws and clears are broadcast to each _view index_ whose bit is set in
the view mask.
The view index is provided in the code:ViewIndex shader input variable, and
color, depth/stencil, and input attachments all read/write the layer of the
framebuffer corresponding to the view index.

If the view mask is zero for all subpasses, multiview is considered to be
disabled and all drawing commands execute normally, without this additional
broadcasting.

Some implementations may: not support multiview in conjunction with
<<features-multiview-gs,geometry shaders>> or
<<features-multiview-tess,tessellation shaders>>.

[[renderpass-multiview-view-local]]
When multiview is enabled, the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT bit in a
dependency can: be used to express a view-local dependency, meaning that
each view in the destination subpass depends on a single view in the source
subpass.
Unlike pipeline barriers, a subpass dependency can: potentially have a
different view mask in the source subpass and the destination subpass.
If the dependency is view-local, then each view ([eq]#dstView#) in the
destination subpass depends on the view [eq]#dstView {plus}
pname:pViewOffsets[dependency]# in the source subpass.
If there is not such a view in the source subpass, then this dependency does
not affect that view in the destination subpass.
If the dependency is not view-local, then all views in the destination
subpass depend on all views in the source subpass, and the view offset is
ignored.
A non-zero view offset is not allowed in a self-dependency.

The elements of pname:pCorrelationMasks are a set of masks of views
indicating that views in the same mask may: exhibit spatial coherency
between the views, making it more efficient to render them concurrently.
Correlation masks must: not have a functional effect on the results of the
multiview rendering.

When multiview is enabled, at the beginning of each subpass all non-render
pass state is undefined:.
In particular, each time flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass or
flink:vkCmdNextSubpass is called the graphics pipeline must: be bound, any
relevant descriptor sets or vertex/index buffers must: be bound, and any
relevant dynamic state or push constants must: be set before they are used.

ifdef::VK_NVX_multiview_per_view_attributes[]

A multiview subpass can: declare that its shaders will write per-view
attributes for all views in a single invocation, by setting the
ename:VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX bit in the subpass
description.
The only supported per-view attributes are position and viewport mask, and
per-view position and viewport masks are written to output array variables
decorated with code:PositionPerViewNV and code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV,
respectively.
If `<<VK_NV_viewport_array2>>` is not supported and enabled,
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV must: not be used.
Values written to elements of code:PositionPerViewNV and
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV must: not depend on the code:ViewIndex.
The shader must: also write to an output variable decorated with
code:Position, and the value written to code:Position must: equal the value
written to code:PositionPerViewNV[code:ViewIndex].
Similarly, if code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV is written to then the shader must:
also write to an output variable decorated with code:ViewportMaskNV, and the
value written to code:ViewportMaskNV must: equal the value written to
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV[code:ViewIndex].
Implementations will either use values taken from code:Position and
code:ViewportMaskNV and invoke the shader once for each view, or will use
values taken from code:PositionPerViewNV and code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV and
invoke the shader fewer times.
The values written to code:Position and code:ViewportMaskNV must: not depend
on the values written to code:PositionPerViewNV and
code:ViewportMaskPerViewNV, or vice versa (to allow compilers to eliminate
the unused outputs).
All attributes that do not have `*PerViewNV` counterparts must: not depend
on code:ViewIndex.

Per-view attributes are all-or-nothing for a subpass.
That is, all pipelines compiled against a subpass that includes the
ename:VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX bit must: write
per-view attributes to the `*PerViewNV[]` shader outputs, in addition to the
non-per-view (e.g. code:Position) outputs.
Pipelines compiled against a subpass that does not include this bit must:
not include the `*PerViewNV[]` outputs in their interfaces.

The load and store operations apply on the first and last use of each view
in the render pass, respectively.

[[renderpass-precision]]
During a render pass instance, input/color attachments with color formats
that have a component size of 8, 16, or 32 bits must: be represented in the
attachment's format throughout the instance.
Attachments with other floating- or fixed-point color formats, or with depth
components may: be represented in a format with a precision higher than the
attachment format, but must: be represented with the same range.
When such a component is loaded via the pname:loadOp, it will be converted
into an implementation-dependent format used by the render pass.
Such components must: be converted from the render pass format, to the
format of the attachment, before they are resolved or stored at the end of a
render pass instance via pname:storeOp.
Conversions occur as described in <<fundamentals-numerics,Numeric
Representation and Computation>> and <<fundamentals-fixedconv, Fixed-Point
Data Conversions>>.

[[renderpass-aliasing]]
If pname:flags includes ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT, then
the attachment is treated as if it shares physical memory with another
attachment in the same render pass.
This information limits the ability of the implementation to reorder certain
operations (like layout transitions and the pname:loadOp) such that it is
not improperly reordered against other uses of the same physical memory via
a different attachment.
This is described in more detail below.

If a render pass uses multiple attachments that alias the same device
memory, those attachments must: each include the
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT bit in their attachment
description flags.
Attachments aliasing the same memory occurs in multiple ways:

  * Multiple attachments being assigned the same image view as part of
    framebuffer creation.
  * Attachments using distinct image views that correspond to the same image
    subresource of an image.
  * Attachments using views of distinct image subresources which are bound
    to overlapping memory ranges.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Render passes must: include subpass dependencies (either directly or via a
subpass dependency chain) between any two subpasses that operate on the same
attachment or aliasing attachments and those subpass dependencies must:
include execution and memory dependencies separating uses of the aliases, if
at least one of those subpasses writes to one of the aliases.
These dependencies must: not include the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT
if the aliases are views of distinct image subresources which overlap in
memory.
====

Multiple attachments that alias the same memory must: not be used in a
single subpass.
A given attachment index must: not be used multiple times in a single
subpass, with one exception: two subpass attachments can: use the same
attachment index if at least one use is as an input attachment and neither
use is as a resolve or preserve attachment.
In other words, the same view can: be used simultaneously as an input and
color or depth/stencil attachment, but must: not be used as multiple color
or depth/stencil attachments nor as resolve or preserve attachments.
The precise set of valid scenarios is described in more detail
<<renderpass-feedbackloop, below>>.

If a set of attachments alias each other, then all except the first to be
used in the render pass must: use an pname:initialLayout of
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, since the earlier uses of the other aliases
make their contents undefined:.
Once an alias has been used and a different alias has been used after it,
the first alias must: not be used in any later subpasses.
However, an application can: assign the same image view to multiple aliasing
attachment indices, which allows that image view to be used multiple times
even if other aliases are used in between.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Once an attachment needs the ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT
bit, there should: be no additional cost of introducing additional aliases,
and using these additional aliases may: allow more efficient clearing of the
attachments on multiple uses via ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR.

slink:VkSubpassDependency describes a
<<synchronization-pipeline-barriers-subpass-self-dependencies, subpass
self-dependency>>, and only constrains the pipeline barriers allowed within
a subpass instance.
Otherwise, when a render pass instance which includes a subpass dependency
is submitted to a queue, it defines a memory dependency between the
subpasses identified by pname:srcSubpass and pname:dstSubpass.

If pname:srcSubpass is equal to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, the first
<<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>> includes
commands that occur earlier in <<synchronization-submission-order,submission

Otherwise, the first set of commands includes all commands submitted as part
of the subpass instance identified by pname:srcSubpass and any load, store
or multisample resolve operations on attachments used in pname:srcSubpass.
In either case, the first synchronization scope is limited to operations on
the pipeline stages determined by the

as a part of a flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier (with matching pname:srcStageMask
and pname:dstStageMask parameters).
The only difference being that its scopes are limited to the identified
subpasses rather than potentially affecting everything before and after.

For attachments however, subpass dependencies work more like a
slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier defined similarly to the slink:VkMemoryBarrier
above, the queue family indices set to ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED, and
layouts as follows:

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]

When multiview is enabled, the execution of the multiple views of one
subpass may: not occur simultaneously or even back-to-back, and rather may:
be interleaved with the execution of other subpasses.
The load and store operations apply to attachments on a per-view basis.
For example, an attachment using ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR will have
each view cleared on first use, but the first use of one view may be
temporally distant from the first use of another view.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
A good mental model for multiview is to think of a multiview subpass as if
it were a collection of individual (per-view) subpasses that are logically
grouped together and described as a single multiview subpass in the API.
Similarly, a multiview attachment can be thought of like several individual
attachments that happen to be layers in a single image.
A view-local dependency between two multiview subpasses acts like a set of
one-to-one dependencies between corresponding pairs of per-view subpasses.
A view-global dependency between two multiview subpasses acts like a set of
[eq]#N {times} M# dependencies between all pairs of per-view subpasses in
the source and destination.
Thus, it is a more compact representation which also makes clear the
commonality and reuse that is present between views in a subpass.
This interpretation motivates the answers to questions like "`when does the
load op apply`" - it is on the first use of each view of an attachment, as
if each view were a separate attachment.

====
The following two alleged implicit dependencies are practically no-ops, as
the operations they describe are already guaranteed by semaphores and
submission order (so they are almost entirely no-ops on their own).
The *only* reason they exist is because it simplifies reasoning about where
<<renderpass-layout-transitions, automatic layout transitions>> happen.
Further rewrites of this chapter could potentially remove the need for
these.

endif::editing-notes[]

If there is no subpass dependency from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the
first subpass that uses an attachment, then an implicit subpass dependency
exists from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the first subpass it is used in.
The implicit subpass dependency only exists if there exists an automatic
layout transition away from pname:initialLayout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL;
    .dstSubpass = firstSubpass; // First subpass attachment is used in
    .srcStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT;
    .dstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT;
    .srcAccessMask = 0;
    .dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |

    .dependencyFlags = 0;
};
---------------------------------------------------

Similarly, if there is no subpass dependency from the last subpass that uses
an attachment to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, then an implicit subpass
dependency exists from the last subpass it is used in to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL.
The implicit subpass dependency only exists if there exists an automatic
layout transition into pname:finalLayout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = lastSubpass; // Last subpass attachment is used in
    .dstSubpass = VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL;

[[renderpass-layout-transitions]]
As subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to other
subpasses unless a subpass dependency chain describes otherwise, the layout
transitions required between subpasses cannot: be known to an application.
Instead, an application provides the layout that each attachment must: be in
at the start and end of a render pass, and the layout it must: be in during
each subpass it is used in.
The implementation then must: execute layout transitions between subpasses
in order to guarantee that the images are in the layouts required by each
subpass, and in the final layout at the end of the render pass.

Automatic layout transitions apply to the entire image subresource attached
to the framebuffer.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_maintenance1[]
If the attachment view is a 2D or 2D array view of a 3D image, even if the
attachment view only refers to a subset of the slices of the selected mip
level of the 3D image, automatic layout transitions apply to the entire
subresource referenced which is the entire mip level in this case.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_maintenance1[]

Automatic layout transitions away from the layout used in a subpass
happen-after the availability operations for all dependencies with that
subpass as the pname:srcSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions into the layout used in a subpass happen-before
the visibility operations for all dependencies with that subpass as the
pname:dstSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happens-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses the attachment
that will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happen-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

Automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happens-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses the attachment that
will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happen-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

ifdef::VK_EXT_sample_locations[]

The image layout of the depth aspect of a depth/stencil attachment referring
to an image created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT is dependent
on the last sample locations used to render to the attachment, thus
automatic layout transitions use the sample locations state specified in
slink:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT.

Automatic layout transitions of an attachment referring to a depth/stencil
image created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT use the
sample locations the image subresource range referenced by the attachment
was last rendered with.
If the current render pass does not use the attachment as a depth/stencil
attachment in any subpass that happens-before, the automatic layout
transition uses the sample locations state specified in the
pname:sampleLocationsInfo member of the element of the
sname:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT::pname:pAttachmentInitialSampleLocations
array for which the pname:attachmentIndex member equals the attachment index
of the attachment, if one is specified.
Otherwise, the automatic layout transition uses the sample locations state
specified in the pname:sampleLocationsInfo member of the element of the
sname:VkRenderPassSampleLocationsBeginInfoEXT::pname:pPostSubpassSampleLocations
array for which the pname:subpassIndex member equals the index of the
subpass that last used the attachment as a depth/stencil attachment, if one
is specified.

If no sample locations state has been specified for an automatic layout
transition performed on an attachment referring to a depth/stencil image
created with ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT
the contents of the depth aspect of the depth/stencil attachment become
undefined: as if the layout of the attachment was transitioned from the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED layout.

endif::VK_EXT_sample_locations[]

If two subpasses use the same attachment, and both subpasses use the
attachment in a read-only layout, no subpass dependency needs to be
specified between those subpasses.
If an implementation treats those layouts separately, it must: insert an
implicit subpass dependency between those subpasses to separate the uses in
each layout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
// Used for input attachments
VkPipelineStageFlags inputAttachmentStages = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT;
VkAccessFlags inputAttachmentAccess = VK_ACCESS_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT;

// Used for depth/stencil attachments
VkPipelineStageFlags depthStencilAttachmentStages = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT | VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT;
VkAccessFlags depthStencilAttachmentAccess = VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT;

VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = firstSubpass;
    .dstSubpass = secondSubpass;
    .srcStageMask = inputAttachmentStages | depthStencilAttachmentStages;
    .dstStageMask = inputAttachmentStages | depthStencilAttachmentStages;
    .srcAccessMask = inputAttachmentAccess | depthStencilAttachmentAccess;
    .dstAccessMask = inputAttachmentAccess | depthStencilAttachmentAccess;
    .dependencyFlags = 0;
};
---------------------------------------------------

[[renderpass-feedbackloop]]
If a subpass uses the same attachment as both an input attachment and either
a color attachment or a depth/stencil attachment, writes via the color or
depth/stencil attachment are not automatically made visible to reads via the
input attachment, causing a _feedback loop_, except in any of the following
conditions:

  * If the color components or depth/stencil components read by the input
    attachment are mutually exclusive with the components written by the

    This requires the graphics pipelines used by the subpass to disable
    writes to color components that are read as inputs via the

    that are read as inputs via pname:depthWriteEnable or

[[renderpass-compatibility]]
== Render Pass Compatibility

Framebuffers and graphics pipelines are created based on a specific render
pass object.
They must: only be used with that render pass object, or one compatible with
it.

Two attachment references are compatible if they have matching format and
sample count, or are both ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED or the pointer that
would contain the reference is `NULL`.

Two arrays of attachment references are compatible if all corresponding
pairs of attachments are compatible.
If the arrays are of different lengths, attachment references not present in
the smaller array are treated as ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.

Two render passes are compatible if their corresponding color, input,
resolve, and depth/stencil attachment references are compatible and if they
are otherwise identical except for:

  * Initial and final image layout in attachment descriptions
  * Load and store operations in attachment descriptions
  * Image layout in attachment references

== Framebuffers

[open,refpage='VkFramebuffer',desc='Opaque handle to a framebuffer object',type='handles']
--

Render passes operate in conjunction with _framebuffers_.
Framebuffers represent a collection of specific memory attachments that a
render pass instance uses.

Framebuffers are represented by sname:VkFramebuffer handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkFramebuffer.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='vkCreateFramebuffer',desc='Create a new framebuffer object',type='protos']
--

To create a framebuffer, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateFramebuffer.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the framebuffer.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkFramebufferCreateInfo
    structure describing additional information about framebuffer creation.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pFramebuffer is a pointer to a slink:VkFramebuffer handle in which
    the resulting framebuffer object is returned.

The sname:VkFramebufferCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkFramebufferCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkFramebufferCreateFlagBits
  * pname:renderPass is a render pass defining what render passes the
    framebuffer will be compatible with.
    See <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass Compatibility>> for details.
  * pname:attachmentCount is the number of attachments.
  * pname:pAttachments is a pointer to an array of slink:VkImageView
    handles, each of which will be used as the corresponding attachment in a
    render pass instance.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_imageless_framebuffer[]
    If pname:flags includes ename:VK_FRAMEBUFFER_CREATE_IMAGELESS_BIT, this
    parameter is ignored.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_imageless_framebuffer[]
  * pname:width, pname:height and pname:layers define the dimensions of the
    framebuffer.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]
    If the render pass uses multiview, then pname:layers must: be one and
    each attachment requires a number of layers that is greater than the
    maximum bit index set in the view mask in the subpasses in which it is
    used.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_multiview[]

Applications must: ensure that all accesses to memory that backs image
subresources used as attachments in a given renderpass instance either
happen-before the <<renderpass-load-store-ops, load operations>> for those
attachments, or happen-after the <<renderpass-load-store-ops, store
operations>> for those attachments.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_maintenance2[]
For depth/stencil attachments, each aspect can: be used separately as
attachments and non-attachments as long as the non-attachment accesses are
also via an image subresource in either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL layout or
the ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL layout,
and the attachment resource uses whichever of those two layouts the image
accesses do not.
Use of non-attachment aspects in this case is only well defined if the
attachment is used in the subpass where the non-attachment access is being
made, or the layout of the image subresource is constant throughout the
entire render pass instance, including the pname:initialLayout and
pname:finalLayout.

[[renderpass-noattachments]]
It is legal for a subpass to use no color or depth/stencil attachments,
either because it has no attachment references or because all of them are
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.
This kind of subpass can: use shader side effects such as image stores and
atomics to produce an output.
In this case, the subpass continues to use the pname:width, pname:height,
and pname:layers of the framebuffer to define the dimensions of the
rendering area, and the pname:rasterizationSamples from each pipeline's
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo to define the number of samples
used in rasterization; however, if
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures::pname:variableMultisampleRate is
ename:VK_FALSE, then all pipelines to be bound with the subpass must: have
the same value for
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo::pname:rasterizationSamples.

== Render Pass Commands

An application records the commands for a render pass instance one subpass
at a time, by beginning a render pass instance, iterating over the subpasses
to record commands for that subpass, and then ending the render pass
instance.

[open,refpage='vkCmdBeginRenderPass',desc='Begin a new render pass',type='protos']
--

To begin a render pass instance, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdBeginRenderPass.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to record the
    command.
  * pname:pRenderPassBegin is a pointer to a slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo
    structure specifying the render pass to begin an instance of, and the
    framebuffer the instance uses.
  * pname:contents is a elink:VkSubpassContents value specifying how the
    commands in the first subpass will be provided.

After beginning a render pass instance, the command buffer is ready to
record the commands for the first subpass of that render pass.

The pname:deviceMask serves several purposes.
It is an upper bound on the set of physical devices that can: be used during
the render pass instance, and the initial device mask when the render pass
instance begins.
In addition, commands transitioning to the next subpass in the render pass
instance and commands ending the render pass instance, and, accordingly
render pass attachment load, store, and resolve operations and subpass
dependencies corresponding to the render pass instance, are executed on the
physical devices included in the device mask provided here.

If pname:deviceRenderAreaCount is not zero, then the elements of
pname:pDeviceRenderAreas override the value of
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pname:renderArea, and provide a render area
specific to each physical device.
These render areas serve the same purpose as
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pname:renderArea, including controlling the
region of attachments that are cleared by ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR
and that are resolved into resolve attachments.

If this structure is not present, the render pass instance's device mask is
