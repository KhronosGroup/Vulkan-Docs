When a swapchain associated with a display surface is destroyed, if the
image most recently presented to the display surface is from the swapchain
being destroyed, then either any display resources modified by presenting
images from any swapchain associated with the display surface must: be
reverted by the implementation to their state prior to the first present
performed on one of these swapchains, or such resources must: be left in
their current state.
