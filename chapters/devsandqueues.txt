[[devsandqueues]]
= Devices and Queues

Once Vulkan is initialized, devices and queues are the primary objects used
to interact with a Vulkan implementation.

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDevice',desc='Opaque handle to a physical device object',type='handles']
--

Vulkan separates the concept of _physical_ and _logical_ devices.
A physical device usually represents a single complete implementation of
Vulkan (excluding instance-level functionality) available to the host, of
which there are a finite number.
A logical device represents an instance of that implementation with its own
state and resources independent of other logical devices.

Physical devices are represented by sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles:

To retrieve a list of physical device objects representing the physical
devices installed in the system, call:

include::../api/protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

  * pname:instance is a handle to a Vulkan instance previously created with
    flink:vkCreateInstance.
  * pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of physical devices available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPhysicalDevices is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles.

If pname:pPhysicalDevices is `NULL`, then the number of physical devices
available is returned in pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount.
Otherwise, pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount must: point to a variable set by the
user to the number of elements in the pname:pPhysicalDevices array, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of handles actually
written to pname:pPhysicalDevices.
If pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is less than the number of physical devices
available, at most pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount structures will be written.
If pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is smaller than the number of physical devices
available, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS,
to indicate that not all the available physical devices were returned.

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

  * pname:apiVersion is the version of Vulkan supported by the device,
    encoded as described in the <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version
    Numbers and Semantics>> section.
  * pname:driverVersion is the vendor-specified version of the driver.
  * pname:vendorID is a unique identifier for the _vendor_ (see below) of
    the physical device.
  * pname:deviceID is a unique identifier for the physical device among
    devices available from the vendor.
  * pname:deviceType is a elink:VkPhysicalDeviceType specifying the type of
    device.
  * pname:deviceName is a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name
    of the device.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE,
    containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier
    for the device.
  * pname:limits is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure which
    specifies device-specific limits of the physical device.
    See <<features-limits,Limits>> for details.
  * pname:sparseProperties is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties
    structure which specifies various sparse related properties of the
    physical device.
    See <<sparsememory-physicalprops,Sparse Properties>> for details.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
[NOTE]
.Note
====
The value of pname:apiVersion may: be different than the version returned by
flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion; either higher or lower.
In such cases, the application must: not use functionality that exceeds the
version of Vulkan associated with a given object.
The pname:pApiVersion parameter returned by flink:vkEnumerateInstanceVersion
is the version associated with a slink:VkInstance and its children, except
for a slink:VkPhysicalDevice and its children.
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:apiVersion is the version associated
with a slink:VkPhysicalDevice and its children.
====
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]

The pname:vendorID and pname:deviceID fields are provided to allow
applications to adapt to device characteristics that are not adequately
exposed by other Vulkan queries.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
These may: include performance profiles, hardware errata, or other
characteristics.
====

The _vendor_ identified by pname:vendorID is the entity responsible for the
most salient characteristics of the underlying implementation of the
slink:VkPhysicalDevice being queried.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For example, in the case of a discrete GPU implementation, this should: be
the GPU chipset vendor.
In the case of a hardware accelerator integrated into a system-on-chip
(SoC), this should: be the supplier of the silicon IP used to create the
accelerator.
====

If the vendor has a https://pcisig.com/membership/member-companies[PCI
vendor ID], the low 16 bits of pname:vendorID must: contain that PCI vendor
ID, and the remaining bits must: be set to zero.
Otherwise, the value returned must: be a valid Khronos vendor ID, obtained
as described in the <<vulkan-styleguide,Vulkan Documentation and Extensions:
Procedures and Conventions>> document in the section "`Registering a Vendor
ID with Khronos`".
Khronos vendor IDs are allocated starting at 0x10000, to distinguish them
from the PCI vendor ID namespace.
Khronos vendor IDs are symbolically defined in the elink:VkVendorId type.

The vendor is also responsible for the value returned in pname:deviceID.
If the implementation is driven primarily by a https://pcisig.com/[PCI
device] with a https://pcisig.com/[PCI device ID], the low 16 bits of
pname:deviceID must: contain that PCI device ID, and the remaining bits
must: be set to zero.
Otherwise, the choice of what values to return may: be dictated by operating
system or platform policies - but should: uniquely identify both the device
version and any major configuration options (for example, core count in the
case of multicore devices).

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The same device ID should: be used for all physical implementations of that
device version and configuration.
For example, all uses of a specific silicon IP GPU version and configuration
should: use the same device ID, even if those uses occur in different SoCs.

Khronos vendor IDs may be allocated by vendors at any time.
Only the latest canonical versions of this Specification, of the
corresponding `vk.xml` API Registry, and of the corresponding
`vulkan_core.h` header file must: contain all reserved Khronos vendor IDs.

Only Khronos vendor IDs are given symbolic names at present.
PCI vendor IDs returned by the implementation can be looked up in the

The physical device types which may: be returned in
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:deviceType are:

include::../api/enums/VkPhysicalDeviceType.txt[]

  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER - the device does not match any
    other available types.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU - the device is typically
    one embedded in or tightly coupled with the host.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU - the device is typically a
    separate processor connected to the host via an interlink.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU - the device is typically a
    virtual node in a virtualization environment.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU - the device is typically running on
    the same processors as the host.

The physical device type is advertised for informational purposes only, and
does not directly affect the operation of the system.
However, the device type may: correlate with other advertised properties or
capabilities of the system, such as how many memory heaps there are.

  * pname:deviceUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE, containing
    8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier for the

  * pname:driverUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE, containing
    8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier for the

  * pname:deviceLUID is an array of size ename:VK_LUID_SIZE, containing
    8-bit values that represent a locally unique identifier for the device.
  * pname:deviceNodeMask is a bitfield identifying the node within a linked
    device adapter corresponding to the device.
  * pname:deviceLUIDValid is a boolean value that will be ename:VK_TRUE if
    pname:deviceLUID contains a valid LUID and pname:deviceNodeMask contains
    a valid node mask, and ename:VK_FALSE if they do not.

pname:deviceUUID must: be immutable for a given device across instances,
processes, driver APIs, driver versions, and system reboots.

Applications can: compare the pname:driverUUID value across instance and
process boundaries, and can: make similar queries in external APIs to
determine whether they are capable of sharing memory objects and resources
using them with the device.

pname:deviceUUID and/or pname:driverUUID must: be used to determine whether
a particular external object can be shared between driver components, where
such a restriction exists as defined in the compatibility table for the
particular object type:

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_memory_capabilities[]

endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities[]

If pname:deviceLUIDValid is ename:VK_FALSE, the contents of pname:deviceLUID
and pname:deviceNodeMask are undefined.
If pname:deviceLUIDValid is ename:VK_TRUE and Vulkan is running on the
Windows operating system, the contents of pname:deviceLUID can: be cast to
an sname:LUID object and must: be equal to the locally unique identifier of
a sname:IDXGIAdapter1 object that corresponds to pname:physicalDevice.
If pname:deviceLUIDValid is ename:VK_TRUE, pname:deviceNodeMask must:
contain exactly one bit.
If Vulkan is running on an operating system that supports the Direct3D 12
API and pname:physicalDevice corresponds to an individual device in a linked
device adapter, pname:deviceNodeMask identifies the Direct3D 12 node
corresponding to pname:physicalDevice.
Otherwise, pname:deviceNodeMask must: be `1`.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Although they have identical descriptions,
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties::pname:deviceUUID may differ from
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2::pname:pipelineCacheUUID.
The former is intended to identify and correlate devices across API and
driver boundaries, while the latter is used to identify a compatible device
and driver combination to use when serializing and de-serializing pipeline
state.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
While slink:VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties::pname:deviceUUID is specified to
remain consistent across driver versions and system reboots, it is not
intended to be usable as a serializable persistent identifier for a device.
It may change when a device is physically added to, removed from, or moved
to a different connector in a system while that system is powered down.
Further, there is no reasonable way to verify with conformance testing that
a given device retains the same UUID in a given system across all driver
versions supported in that system.
While implementations should make every effort to report consistent device
UUIDs across driver versions, applications should avoid relying on the
persistence of this value for uses other than identifying compatible devices
for external object sharing purposes.

  * pname:queueCount is the unsigned integer count of queues in this queue
    family.
  * pname:timestampValidBits is the unsigned integer count of meaningful
    bits in the timestamps written via fname:vkCmdWriteTimestamp.
    The valid range for the count is 36..64 bits, or a value of 0,
    indicating no support for timestamps.
    Bits outside the valid range are guaranteed to be zeros.
  * pname:minImageTransferGranularity is the minimum granularity supported
    for image transfer operations on the queues in this queue family.

The value returned in pname:minImageTransferGranularity has a unit of
compressed texel blocks for images having a block-compressed format, and a
unit of texels otherwise.

Possible values of pname:minImageTransferGranularity are:

  * [eq]#(0,0,0)# which indicates that only whole mip levels must: be
    transferred using the image transfer operations on the corresponding
    queues.
    In this case, the following restrictions apply to all offset and extent
    parameters of image transfer operations:

  ** The pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z members of a slink:VkOffset3D
     parameter must: always be zero.
  ** The pname:width, pname:height, and pname:depth members of a
     slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: always match the width, height, and
     depth of the image subresource corresponding to the parameter,
     respectively.

  * [eq]#(A~x~, A~y~, A~z~)# where [eq]#A~x~#, [eq]#A~y~#, and [eq]#A~z~#
    are all integer powers of two.
    In this case the following restrictions apply to all image transfer
    operations:

  ** pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z of a slink:VkOffset3D parameter must: be
     integer multiples of [eq]#A~x~#, [eq]#A~y~#, and [eq]#A~z~#,
     respectively.
  ** pname:width of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~x~#, or else [eq]#pname:x {plus} pname:width# must:
     equal the width of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** pname:height of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~y~#, or else [eq]#pname:y {plus} pname:height# must:
     equal the height of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** pname:depth of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~z~#, or else [eq]#pname:z {plus} pname:depth# must:
     equal the depth of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** If the format of the image corresponding to the parameters is one of
     the block-compressed formats then for the purposes of the above
     calculations the granularity must: be scaled up by the compressed texel
     block dimensions.

Queues supporting graphics and/or compute operations must: report
[eq]#(1,1,1)# in pname:minImageTransferGranularity, meaning that there are
no additional restrictions on the granularity of image transfer operations
for these queues.
Other queues supporting image transfer operations are only required: to
support whole mip level transfers, thus pname:minImageTransferGranularity
for queues belonging to such queue families may: be [eq]#(0,0,0)#.

    implementation must: support this bit.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]

operations, at least one queue family of at least one physical device
exposed by the implementation must: support both graphics and compute
operations.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
All commands that are allowed on a queue that supports transfer operations
are also allowed on a queue that supports either graphics or compute

== Devices

Device objects represent logical connections to physical devices.
Each device exposes a number of _queue families_ each having one or more
_queues_.
All queues in a queue family support the same operations.

As described in <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Devices>>, a Vulkan application will first query for all physical devices in
a system.
Each physical device can: then be queried for its capabilities, including
its queue and queue family properties.
Once an acceptable physical device is identified, an application will create
a corresponding logical device.
An application must: create a separate logical device for each physical
device it will use.
The created logical device is then the primary interface to the physical
device.

How to enumerate the physical devices in a system and query those physical
devices for their queue family properties is described in the
<<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration, Physical Device Enumeration>>
section above.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_device_group_creation[]

A single logical device can: also be created from multiple physical devices,
if those physical devices belong to the same device group.
A _device group_ is a set of physical devices that support accessing each
other's memory and recording a single command buffer that can: be executed
on all the physical devices.
Device groups are enumerated by calling
flink:vkEnumeratePhysicalDeviceGroups, and a logical device is created from
a subset of the physical devices in a device group by passing the physical
devices through slink:VkDeviceGroupDeviceCreateInfo.

If pname:pPhysicalDeviceGroupProperties is `NULL`, then the number of device
groups available is returned in pname:pPhysicalDeviceGroupCount.
Otherwise, pname:pPhysicalDeviceGroupCount must: point to a variable set by
the user to the number of elements in the

groups available, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of

    See <<pipelines,Pipelines>> and <<descriptorsets,Resource Descriptors>>,
    among others, for further details.


[[devsandqueues-lost-device]]
=== Lost Device

A logical device may: become _lost_ for a number of implementation-specific
reasons, indicating that pending and future command execution may: fail and
cause resources and backing memory to become undefined.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Typical reasons for device loss will include things like execution timing
out (to prevent denial of service), power management events, platform
resource management, or implementation errors.
====

When this happens, certain commands will return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST
(see <<fundamentals-errorcodes,Error Codes>> for a list of such commands).
After any such event, the logical device is considered _lost_.
It is not possible to reset the logical device to a non-lost state, however
the lost state is specific to a logical device (sname:VkDevice), and the
corresponding physical device (sname:VkPhysicalDevice) may: be otherwise
unaffected.

In some cases, the physical device may: also be lost, and attempting to
create a new logical device will fail, returning ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
This is usually indicative of a problem with the underlying implementation,
or its connection to the host.
If the physical device has not been lost, and a new logical device is
successfully created from that physical device, it must: be in the non-lost
state.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Whilst logical device loss may: be recoverable, in the case of physical
device loss, it is unlikely that an application will be able to recover
unless additional, unaffected physical devices exist on the system.
The error is largely informational and intended only to inform the user that
a platform issue has occurred, and should: be investigated further.
For example, underlying hardware may: have developed a fault or become
physically disconnected from the rest of the system.
In many cases, physical device loss may: cause other more serious issues
such as the operating system crashing; in which case it may: not be reported
via the Vulkan API.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Undefined behavior caused by an application error may: cause a device to
become lost.
However, such undefined behavior may: also cause unrecoverable damage to the
process, and it is then not guaranteed that the API objects, including the
sname:VkPhysicalDevice or the sname:VkInstance are still valid or that the
error is recoverable.
====

When a device is lost, its child objects are not implicitly destroyed and
their handles are still valid.
Those objects must: still be destroyed before their parents or the device
can: be destroyed (see the <<fundamentals-objectmodel-lifetime,Object
Lifetime>> section).
The host address space corresponding to device memory mapped using
flink:vkMapMemory is still valid, and host memory accesses to these mapped
regions are still valid, but the contents are undefined.
It is still legal to call any API command on the device and child objects.

Once a device is lost, command execution may: fail, and commands that return
a elink:VkResult may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
Commands that do not allow run-time errors must: still operate correctly for
valid usage and, if applicable, return valid data.

Commands that wait indefinitely for device execution (namely
flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle, flink:vkQueueWaitIdle, flink:vkWaitForFences
ifdef::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
or flink:vkAcquireNextImageKHR
endif::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
with a maximum pname:timeout, and flink:vkGetQueryPoolResults with the
ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT bit set in pname:flags) must: return in
finite time even in the case of a lost device, and return either
ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
For any command that may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST, for the purpose
of determining whether a command buffer is in the
<<commandbuffers-lifecycle, pending state>>, or whether resources are
considered in-use by the device, a return value of
ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST is equivalent to ename:VK_SUCCESS.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_memory[]

The content of any external memory objects that have been exported from or
imported to a lost device become undefined.
Objects on other logical devices or in other APIs which are associated with
the same underlying memory resource as the external memory objects on the
lost device are unaffected other than their content becoming undefined.
The layout of subresources of images on other logical devices that are bound
to sname:VkDeviceMemory objects associated with the same underlying memory
resources as external memory objects on the lost device becomes
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED.

endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_memory[]

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_semaphore[]

The state of sname:VkSemaphore objects on other logical devices created by
<<synchronization-semaphores-importing,importing a semaphore payload>> with
temporary permanence which was exported from the lost device is undefined.
The state of sname:VkSemaphore objects on other logical devices that
permanently share a semaphore payload with a sname:VkSemaphore object on the
lost device is undefined, and remains undefined following any subsequent
signal operations.
Implementations must: ensure pending and subsequently submitted wait
operations on such semaphores behave as defined in
<<synchronization-semaphores-waiting-state,Semaphore State Requirements For
Wait Operations>> for external semaphores not in a valid state for a wait
operation.

endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_external_semaphore[]

  * pname:device is the logical device to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

To ensure that no work is active on the device, flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle can:
be used to gate the destruction of the device.
Prior to destroying a device, an application is responsible for
destroying/freeing any Vulkan objects that were created using that device as
the first parameter of the corresponding ftext:vkCreate* or
ftext:vkAllocate* command.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The lifetime of each of these objects is bound by the lifetime of the
sname:VkDevice object.

explicitly free all of these resources prior to calling
fname:vkDestroyDevice.

[[devsandqueues-queues]]
== Queues


[[devsandqueues-queueprops]]
=== Queue Family Properties

As discussed in the <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Device Enumeration>> section above, the
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties command is used to retrieve
details about the queue families and queues supported by a device.

Each index in the pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties describes a unique queue
family on that physical device.
These indices are used when creating queues, and they correspond directly
with the pname:queueFamilyIndex that is passed to the flink:vkCreateDevice
command via the slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure as described in the
<<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below.

Grouping of queue families within a physical device is
implementation-dependent.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The general expectation is that a physical device groups all queues of
matching capabilities into a single family.
However, while implementations should: do this, it is possible that a
physical device may: return two separate queue families with the same
capabilities.
====

Once an application has identified a physical device with the queue(s) that
it desires to use, it will create those queues in conjunction with a logical
device.
This is described in the following section.


[[devsandqueues-queue-creation]]
=== Queue Creation

[open,refpage='VkQueue',desc='Opaque handle to a queue object',type='handles']
--

Creating a logical device also creates the queues associated with that
device.
The queues to create are described by a set of slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo
structures that are passed to flink:vkCreateDevice in
pname:pQueueCreateInfos.

Queues are represented by sname:VkQueue handles:

include::../api/handles/VkQueue.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo',desc='Structure specifying parameters of a newly created device queue',type='structs']

endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
  * pname:flags is a bitmask indicating behavior of the queue.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex is an unsigned integer indicating the index of
    the queue family to create on this device.
    This index corresponds to the index of an element of the
    pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array that was returned by
    fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.
  * pname:queueCount is an unsigned integer specifying the number of queues
    to create in the queue family indicated by pname:queueFamilyIndex.
  * pname:pQueuePriorities is an array of pname:queueCount normalized
    floating point values, specifying priorities of work that will be
    submitted to each created queue.
    See <<devsandqueues-priority,Queue Priority>> for more information.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-queueFamilyIndex-00381]]

A queue can: be created with a system-wide priority by including a
sname:VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT structure in the pname:pNext
chain of slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo.

The sname:VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:globalPriority is the system-wide priority associated to this
    queue as specified by elink:VkQueueGlobalPriorityEXT

A queue created without specifying
sname:VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT will default to
ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT.

include::../validity/structs/VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkQueueGlobalPriorityEXT',desc='Values specifying a system-wide queue priority',type='enums']
--

Possible values of
slink:VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT::pname:globalPriority,
specifying a system-wide priority level are:

include::../api/enums/VkQueueGlobalPriorityEXT.txt[]

Priority values are sorted in ascending order.
A comparison operation on the enum values can be used to determine the
priority order.

  * ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_LOW_EXT is below the system default.
    Useful for non-interactive tasks.
  * ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT is the system default
    priority.
  * ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_HIGH_EXT is above the system default.
  * ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_EXT is the highest priority.
    Useful for critical tasks.
--

Queues with higher system priority may: be allotted more processing time
than queues with lower priority.
An implementation may: allow a higher-priority queue to starve a
lower-priority queue until the higher-priority queue has no further commands
to execute.

Priorities imply no ordering or scheduling constraints.

No specific guarantees are made about higher priority queues receiving more
processing time or better quality of service than lower priority queues.

The global priority level of a queue takes precedence over the per-process
queue priority (sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo::pname:pQueuePriorities).

Abuse of this feature may: result in starving the rest of the system of
implementation resources.
Therefore, the driver implementation may: deny requests to acquire a
priority above the default priority
(ename:VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT) if the caller does not have
sufficient privileges.
In this scenario ename:VK_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED_EXT is returned.

The driver implementation may: fail the queue allocation request if
resources required to complete the operation have been exhausted (either by
the same process or a different process).
In this scenario ename:VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED is returned.

[[devsandqueues-index]]
=== Queue Family Index

The queue family index is used in multiple places in Vulkan in order to tie
operations to a specific family of queues.

When retrieving a handle to the queue via fname:vkGetDeviceQueue, the queue
family index is used to select which queue family to retrieve the
sname:VkQueue handle from as described in the previous section.

When creating a sname:VkCommandPool object (see
<<commandbuffers-pools,Command Pools>>), a queue family index is specified
in the slink:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure.
Command buffers from this pool can: only be submitted on queues
corresponding to this queue family.

When creating sname:VkImage (see <<resources-images,Images>>) and
sname:VkBuffer (see <<resources-buffers,Buffers>>) resources, a set of queue
families is included in the slink:VkImageCreateInfo and
slink:VkBufferCreateInfo structures to specify the queue families that can:
access the resource.

When inserting a slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier or slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier
(see <<synchronization-events>>) a source and destination queue family index
is specified to allow the ownership of a buffer or image to be transferred
from one queue family to another.
See the <<resources-sharing,Resource Sharing>> section for details.


[[devsandqueues-priority]]
=== Queue Priority

Each queue is assigned a priority, as set in the
slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures when creating the device.
The priority of each queue is a normalized floating point value between 0.0
and 1.0, which is then translated to a discrete priority level by the
implementation.
Higher values indicate a higher priority, with 0.0 being the lowest priority
and 1.0 being the highest.

Within the same device, queues with higher priority may: be allotted more
processing time than queues with lower priority.
The implementation makes no guarantees with regards to ordering or
scheduling among queues with the same priority, other than the constraints
defined by any <<synchronization, explicit synchronization primitives>>.
The implementation make no guarantees with regards to queues across
different devices.

An implementation may: allow a higher-priority queue to starve a
lower-priority queue on the same sname:VkDevice until the higher-priority
queue has no further commands to execute.
The relationship of queue priorities must: not cause queues on one
sname:VkDevice to starve queues on another sname:VkDevice.

No specific guarantees are made about higher priority queues receiving more
processing time or better quality of service than lower priority queues.


[[devsandqueues-submission]]
=== Queue Submission

Work is submitted to a queue via _queue submission_ commands such as
flink:vkQueueSubmit.
Queue submission commands define a set of _queue operations_ to be executed
by the underlying physical device, including synchronization with semaphores
and fences.

Submission commands take as parameters a target queue, zero or more
_batches_ of work, and an optional: fence to signal upon completion.
Each batch consists of three distinct parts:

  . Zero or more semaphores to wait on before execution of the rest of the
    batch.
  ** If present, these describe a <<synchronization-semaphores-waiting,
     semaphore wait operation>>.
  . Zero or more work items to execute.
  ** If present, these describe a _queue operation_ matching the work
     described.
  . Zero or more semaphores to signal upon completion of the work items.
  ** If present, these describe a <<synchronization-semaphores-signaling,
     semaphore signal operation>>.

If a fence is present in a queue submission, it describes a
<<synchronization-fences-signaling, fence signal operation>>.

All work described by a queue submission command must: be submitted to the
queue before the command returns.


[[devsandqueues-sparsebinding]]
==== Sparse Memory Binding

In Vulkan it is possible to sparsely bind memory to buffers and images as
described in the <<sparsememory,Sparse Resource>> chapter.
Sparse memory binding is a queue operation.
A queue whose flags include the ename:VK_QUEUE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT must: be
able to support the mapping of a virtual address to a physical address on
the device.
This causes an update to the page table mappings on the device.
This update must: be synchronized on a queue to avoid corrupting page table
mappings during execution of graphics commands.
By binding the sparse memory resources on queues, all commands that are
dependent on the updated bindings are synchronized to only execute after the
binding is updated.
See the <<synchronization,Synchronization and Cache Control>> chapter for
how this synchronization is accomplished.


[[devsandqueues-queuedestruction]]
=== Queue Destruction

Queues are created along with a logical device during fname:vkCreateDevice.
All queues associated with a logical device are destroyed when
fname:vkDestroyDevice is called on that device.
