Possible values of slink:VkDisplayPowerInfoEXT::pname:powerState, specifying
the new power state of a display, are:

include::{generated}/api/enums/VkDisplayPowerStateEXT.txt[]

  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_OFF_EXT specifies that the display is
    powered down.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_SUSPEND_EXT specifies that the display is
    put into a low power mode, from which it may: be able to transition back
    to ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_ON_EXT more quickly than if it were in
    ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_OFF_EXT.
    This state may: be the same as ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_OFF_EXT.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_POWER_STATE_ON_EXT specifies that the display is
    powered on.
