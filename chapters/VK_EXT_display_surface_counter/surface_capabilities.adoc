:refpage: vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT

To query the basic capabilities of a surface, needed in order to create a
swapchain, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT.adoc[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for
    flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pSurfaceCapabilities is a pointer to a
    slink:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT structure in which the capabilities are
    returned.

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT behaves similarly to
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR, with the ability to return
extended information by adding extending structures to the pname:pNext chain
of its pname:pSurfaceCapabilities parameter.

The sname:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
include::{chapters}/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.adoc[tag=surface_capabilities_members]
  * pname:supportedSurfaceCounters is a bitmask of
    elink:VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT indicating the supported surface
    counter types.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT-supportedSurfaceCounters-01246]]
    pname:supportedSurfaceCounters must: not include
    ename:VK_SURFACE_COUNTER_VBLANK_BIT_EXT unless the surface queried is a
    <<wsi-display-surfaces,display surface>>

Bits which can: be set in
slink:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT::pname:supportedSurfaceCounters, indicating
supported surface counter types, are:

include::{generated}/api/enums/VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT.adoc[]

  * ename:VK_SURFACE_COUNTER_VBLANK_BIT_EXT specifies a counter incrementing
    once every time a vertical blanking period occurs on the display
    associated with the surface.

include::{generated}/api/flags/VkSurfaceCounterFlagsEXT.adoc[]

tname:VkSurfaceCounterFlagsEXT is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero
or more elink:VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT.
