== Controlling Viewport W Scaling

If viewport *W* scaling is enabled, the *W* component of the clip coordinate
is modified by the provided coefficients from the corresponding viewport as
follows.

  {empty}:: [eq]#w~c~' = x~coeff~ x~c~ {plus} y~coeff~ y~c~ {plus} w~c~#

The sname:VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV structure is defined
as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:viewportWScalingEnable controls whether viewport *W* scaling is
    enabled.
  * pname:viewportCount is the number of viewports used by *W* scaling, and
    must: match the number of viewports in the pipeline if viewport *W*
    scaling is enabled.
  * pname:pViewportWScalings is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkViewportWScalingNV structures defining the *W* scaling
    parameters for the corresponding viewports.
    If the viewport *W* scaling state is dynamic, this member is ignored.

The sname:VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV state is set by adding
this structure to the pname:pNext chain of a
sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo structure and setting the graphics
pipeline state with flink:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines.

If the bound pipeline state object was not created with the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_W_SCALING_NV dynamic state enabled, viewport
*W* scaling parameters are specified using the pname:pViewportWScalings
member of slink:VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV in the pipeline
state object.
If the pipeline state object was created with the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_W_SCALING_NV dynamic state enabled, the
viewport transformation parameters are dynamically set and changed with the
command:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdSetViewportWScalingNV.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:firstViewport is the index of the first viewport whose parameters
    are updated by the command.
  * pname:viewportCount is the number of viewports whose parameters are
    updated by the command.
  * pname:pViewportWScalings is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkViewportWScalingNV structures specifying viewport parameters.

The viewport parameters taken from element [eq]#i# of
pname:pViewportWScalings replace the current state for the viewport index
[eq]#pname:firstViewport {plus} i#, for [eq]#i# in [eq]#[0,
pname:viewportCount)#.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkCmdSetViewportWScalingNV-firstViewport-01323]]
    pname:firstViewport must: be less than
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:maxViewports
  * [[VUID-vkCmdSetViewportWScalingNV-firstViewport-01324]]
    The sum of pname:firstViewport and pname:viewportCount must: be between
    `1` and slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:maxViewports, inclusive

Both slink:VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV and
flink:vkCmdSetViewportWScalingNV use sname:VkViewportWScalingNV to set the
viewport transformation parameters.

The sname:VkViewportWScalingNV structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkViewportWScalingNV.txt[]

  * pname:xcoeff and pname:ycoeff are the viewport's W scaling factor for x
    and y respectively.
