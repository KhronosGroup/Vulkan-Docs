To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a Fuchsia ImagePipe, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateImagePipeSurfaceFUCHSIA.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate with the surface.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkImagePipeSurfaceCreateInfoFUCHSIA structure containing
    parameters affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a slink:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The sname:VkImagePipeSurfaceCreateInfoFUCHSIA structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkImagePipeSurfaceCreateInfoFUCHSIA.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:imagePipeHandle is a code:zx_handle_t referring to the ImagePipe
    to associate with the surface.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkImagePipeSurfaceCreateInfoFUCHSIA-imagePipeHandle-00000]]
    pname:imagePipeHandle must: be a valid code:zx_handle_t
****

On Fuchsia, the surface pname:currentExtent is the special value
[eq]#(0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF)#, indicating that the surface size will be
determined by the extent of a swapchain targeting the surface.
