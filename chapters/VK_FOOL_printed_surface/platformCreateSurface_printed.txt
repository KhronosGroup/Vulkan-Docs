To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a physical surface:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreatePrintedSurfaceFOOL.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a sname:VkPrintedSurfaceCreateInfoFOOL
    structure containing the parameters affecting the creation of the
    surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface is a pointer to a slink:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The sname:VkPrintedSurfaceCreateInfoFOOL structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPrintedSurfaceCreateInfoFOOL.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:printer is a handle for a slink:VkPrinterFOOL to associate the surface with.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:printer must: point to a valid slink:VkPrinterFOOL
