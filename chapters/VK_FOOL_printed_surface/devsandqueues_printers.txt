[open,refpage='VkPrinterFOOL',desc='Opaque handle to a printer object',type='handles']
--
Printers are represented by sname:VkPrinterFOOL handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkPrinterFOOL.txt[]

[open,refpage='vkEnumeratePrintersFOOL',desc='Enumerates the printers accessible to a Vulkan instance',type='protos']
--
To retrieve a list of printer objects representing the printers installed in
the system, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkEnumeratePrintersFOOL.txt[]

  * pname:instance is a handle to a Vulkan instance previously created with
    flink:vkCreateInstance.
  * pname:pPrinterCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of printers available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPrinters is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkPrinterFOOL handles.

If pname:pPrinters is `NULL`, then the number of printers available is returned
in pname:pPrinterCount.  Otherwise, pname:pPrinterCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pname:pPrinters
array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of handles
actually written to pname:pPrinters.  If pname:pPrinterCount is less than the
number of printers available, at most pname:pPrinterCount structures will be
written, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS,
to indicate that not all the available printers were returned.

[open,refpage='vkGetPrinterPropertiesFOOL',desc='Returns properties of a printer',type='protos']

To query general properties of printers once enumerated, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetPrinterPropertiesFOOL.txt[]

  * pname:printer is the handle to the printer whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pProperties is a pointer to a slink:VkPrinterPropertiesFOOL
    structure in which properties are returned.

[open,refpage='VkPrinterPropertiesFOOL',desc='Structure specifying printer properties',type='structs']

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkPrinterPropertiesFOOL.txt[]

  * pname:deviceName is an array of ename:VK_MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_NAME_SIZE
    code:char containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is the name of
    the printer.
