== Presenting Directly to Display Devices

In some environments applications can: also present Vulkan rendering
directly to display devices without using an intermediate windowing system.
This can: be useful for embedded applications, or implementing the
rendering/presentation backend of a windowing system using Vulkan.
The `VK_KHR_display` extension provides the functionality necessary to
enumerate display devices and create sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects that target
displays.


=== Display Enumeration

[open,refpage='VkDisplayKHR',desc='Opaque handle to a display object',type='handles']
--

Displays are represented by sname:VkDisplayKHR handles:

include::../../api/handles/VkDisplayKHR.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR',desc='Query information about the available displays',type='protos']
--

Various functions are provided for enumerating the available display devices
present on a Vulkan physical device.
To query information about the available displays, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is a physical device.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    display devices available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDisplayPropertiesKHR structures.

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of display devices available
for pname:physicalDevice is returned in pname:pPropertyCount.
Otherwise, pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to
the number of elements in the pname:pProperties array, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pProperties.
If the value of pname:pPropertyCount is less than the number of display
devices for pname:physicalDevice, at most pname:pPropertyCount structures
will be written.
If pname:pPropertyCount is smaller than the number of display devices
available for pname:physicalDevice, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values
were returned.

include::../../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkDisplayPropertiesKHR',desc='Structure describing an available display device',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkDisplayPropertiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkDisplayPropertiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:display is a handle that is used to refer to the display described
    here.
    This handle will be valid for the lifetime of the Vulkan instance.
  * pname:displayName is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing
    the name of the display.
    Generally, this will be the name provided by the display's EDID.
    It can: be `NULL` if no suitable name is available.
    If not `NULL`, the memory it points to must: remain accessible as long
    as pname:display is valid.
  * pname:physicalDimensions describes the physical width and height of the
    visible portion of the display, in millimeters.
  * pname:physicalResolution describes the physical, native, or preferred
    resolution of the display.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For devices which have no natural value to return here, implementations
should: return the maximum resolution supported.
====

  * pname:supportedTransforms tells which transforms are supported by this
    display.
    This will contain one or more of the bits from
    sname:VkSurfaceTransformFlagsKHR.
  * pname:planeReorderPossible tells whether the planes on this display can:
    have their z order changed.
    If this is ename:VK_TRUE, the application can: re-arrange the planes on
    this display in any order relative to each other.
  * pname:persistentContent tells whether the display supports
    self-refresh/internal buffering.
    If this is true, the application can: submit persistent present
    operations on swapchains created against this display.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Persistent presents may: have higher latency, and may: use less power when
the screen content is updated infrequently, or when only a portion of the
screen needs to be updated in most frames.

planes and displays, or they may: allow arbitrary application specified
stacking orders and mappings between planes and displays.

[open,refpage='vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR',desc='Query capabilities of a mode and plane combination',type='protos']
--

Applications that wish to present directly to a display must: select which
layer, or "`plane`" of the display they wish to target, and a mode to use
with the display.
Each display supports at least one plane.
The capabilities of a given mode and plane combination are determined by
calling:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device associated with
    pname:display
  * pname:mode is the display mode the application intends to program when
    using the specified plane.
    Note this parameter also implicitly specifies a display.
  * pname:planeIndex is the plane which the application intends to use with
    the display, and is less than the number of display planes supported by
    the device.
  * pname:pCapabilities is a pointer to a
    slink:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR structure in which the capabilities
    are returned.

--

[open,refpage='VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR',desc='Structure describing capabilities of a mode and plane combination',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:supportedAlpha is a bitmask of
    elink:VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR describing the supported alpha
    blending modes.
  * pname:minSrcPosition is the minimum source rectangle offset supported by
    this plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:maxSrcPosition is the maximum source rectangle offset supported by
    this plane using the specified mode.
    The pname:x and pname:y components of pname:maxSrcPosition must: each be
    greater than or equal to the pname:x and pname:y components of
    pname:minSrcPosition, respectively.
  * pname:minSrcExtent is the minimum source rectangle size supported by
    this plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:maxSrcExtent is the maximum source rectangle size supported by
    this plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:minDstPosition, pname:maxDstPosition, pname:minDstExtent,
    pname:maxDstExtent all have similar semantics to their corresponding
    ptext:*Src* equivalents, but apply to the output region within the mode
    rather than the input region within the source image.
    Unlike the ptext:*Src* offsets, pname:minDstPosition and
    pname:maxDstPosition may: contain negative values.

The minimum and maximum position and extent fields describe the
implementation limits, if any, as they apply to the specified display mode
and plane.
Vendors may: support displaying a subset of a swapchain's presentable images
on the specified display plane.
This is expressed by returning pname:minSrcPosition, pname:maxSrcPosition,
pname:minSrcExtent, and pname:maxSrcExtent values that indicate a range of
possible positions and sizes may: be used to specify the region within the
presentable images that source pixels will be read from when creating a
swapchain on the specified display mode and plane.

Vendors may: also support mapping the presentable images`' content to a
subset or superset of the visible region in the specified display mode.
This is expressed by returning pname:minDstPosition, pname:maxDstPosition,
pname:minDstExtent and pname:maxDstExtent values that indicate a range of
possible positions and sizes may: be used to describe the region within the
display mode that the source pixels will be mapped to.

Other vendors may: support only a 1-1 mapping between pixels in the
presentable images and the display mode.
This may: be indicated by returning [eq]#(0,0)# for pname:minSrcPosition,
pname:maxSrcPosition, pname:minDstPosition, and pname:maxDstPosition, and
(display mode width, display mode height) for pname:minSrcExtent,
pname:maxSrcExtent, pname:minDstExtent, and pname:maxDstExtent.

These values indicate the limits of the implementation's individual fields.
Not all combinations of values within the offset and extent ranges returned
in sname:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR are guaranteed to be supported.
Vendors may: still fail presentation requests that specify unsupported
combinations.

    alpha value must: be specified that will be applied to all pixels in the
    source image.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_BIT_KHR specifies that the alpha
    value will be determined by the alpha channel of the source image's
    pixels.
    If the source format contains no alpha values, no blending will be
    applied.
    The source alpha values are not premultiplied into the source image's
    other color channels.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_PREMULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR is
    equivalent to ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_BIT_KHR, except the
    source alpha values are assumed to be premultiplied into the source
    image's other color channels.
