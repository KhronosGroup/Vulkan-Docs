The type `id<MTLResource>` is defined in Apple's Metal framework as the
parent type of `id<MTLBuffer>` and `id<MTLTexture>`. We use `id<MTLResource>`
to simplify usage and provide a single common type for both resources. To
remove an unnecessary compile time dependency, an incomplete type definition
of basetype:MTLResource_id is provided in the Vulkan headers:

--
To import memory from a Metal handle, add a
slink:VkImportMemoryMetalHandleInfoEXT structure to the pname:pNext chain of
the slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure.

The sname:VkImportMemoryMetalHandleInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkImportMemoryMetalHandleInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:handleType is a elink:VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits value
    specifying the type of pname:handle or pname:name.
  * pname:handle is `NULL` or the external handle to import.

Importing memory object payloads from Metal handles shares the
ownership of the handle to the Vulkan implementation.

Applications can: import the same payload into multiple instances of Vulkan,
into the same instance from which it was exported, and multiple times into a
given Vulkan instance.
In all cases, each import operation must: create a distinct
sname:VkDeviceMemory object.

.Valid Usage
****
  * If pname:handleType is not `0`, it must: be supported for import, as
    reported by slink:VkExternalImageFormatProperties or
    slink:VkExternalBufferProperties
  * The memory from which pname:handle was exported must: have been created
    on the same underlying physical device as pname:device
  * If pname:handleType is not `0`, it must: be
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLBUFFER_BIT_EXT or
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLTEXTURE_BIT_EXT
  * If pname:handleType is not `0` , pname:handle must: be a valid non-NULL
    handle of the type specified by pname:handleType
  * pname:handle must: obey any requirements listed for pname:handleType in
    <<external-memory-handle-types-compatibility,external memory handle
    types compatibility>>

To export a Metal handle representing the payload of a Vulkan device
memory object, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetMemoryMetalHandleEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that created the device memory being
    exported.
  * pname:pGetMetalHandleInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkMemoryGetMetalHandleInfoEXT structure containing parameters of
    the export operation.
  * pname:pHandle will return the Metal handle representing the payload of
    the device memory object.

The lifespan of the returned handle object is the same as the associated `VkDeviceMemory` object.
The app must: retain the handle object if it intends to use it beyond that lifespan.

The sname:VkMemoryGetMetalHandleInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkMemoryGetMetalHandleInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:memory is the memory object from which the handle will be
    exported.
  * pname:handleType is a elink:VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits value
    specifying the type of handle requested.

The properties of the handle returned depend on the value of
pname:handleType.
See elink:VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits for a description of the
properties of the defined external memory handle types.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:memory must: have been created with a valid
    slink:VkExportMemoryAllocateInfo
  * pname:handleType must: have been included in
    slink:VkExportMemoryAllocateInfo::pname:handleTypes when pname:memory
    was created
  * pname:handleType it must: be
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLBUFFER_BIT_EXT or
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLTEXTURE_BIT_EXT

Metal memory handles compatible with Vulkan may: also be created by
non-Vulkan APIs using methods beyond the scope of this specification.
To determine the correct parameters to use when importing such handles,
call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetMemoryMetalHandlePropertiesEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that will be importing pname:handle.
  * pname:handleType is a elink:VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits value
    specifying the type of the handle pname:handle.
  * pname:handle is the handle which will be imported.
  * pname:pMemoryMetalHandleProperties is a pointer to a
    slink:VkMemoryMetalHandlePropertiesEXT structure in which properties of
    pname:handle are returned.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:handle must: point to a valid MTLResource_id
  * pname:handleType it must: be 
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLBUFFER_BIT_EXT or
    ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLTEXTURE_BIT_EXT

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.

    structure.
  * pname:memoryTypeBits is a bitmask containing one bit set for every
    memory type which the specified Metal handle can: be imported as.
