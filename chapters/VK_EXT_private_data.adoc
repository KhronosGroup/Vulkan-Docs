= Private Data

The private data extension provides a way for users to associate arbitrary
user defined data with Vulkan objects.
This association is accomplished by storing 64-bit unsigned integers of user
defined data in private data slots.
A private data slot represents a storage allocation for one data item for
each child object of the device.

An application can: reserve private data slots at device creation.
To reserve private data slots, insert a slink:VkDevicePrivateDataCreateInfo
in the pname:pNext chain in slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo before device creation.
Multiple slink:VkDevicePrivateDataCreateInfo structures can: be chained
together, and the sum of the requested slots will be reserved.
This is an exception to the specified valid usage for
<<fundamentals-validusage-pNext,structure pointer chains>>.
Reserving slots in this manner is not strictly necessary but it may: improve
performance.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Due to platform details on Android, implementations might not be able to
reliably return `0` from calls to fname:vkGetPrivateData for
slink:VkSwapchainKHR objects on which fname:vkSetPrivateData has not
previously been called.
This erratum is exclusive to the Android platform and objects of type
slink:VkSwapchainKHR.
