[[cluster-culling]]
= Cluster Culling Shading

This shader type has an execution environment similar to that of a compute
shader, where a collection of shader invocations form a workgroup and
cooperate to perform coarse level geometry culling and level-of-detail
selection.
A shader invocation can emit a set of built-in output variables via a new
built-in function.
The cluster culling shader organizes these emitted variables into a drawing
command used by the subsequent rendering pipeline.


[[cluster-culling-input]]
== Cluster Culling Shader Input

The only inputs available to the cluster culling shader are variables
identifying the specific workgroup and invocation.


[[cluster-culling-output]]
== Cluster Culling Shader Output

If a cluster survives after culling in a cluster culling shader invocation,
a drawing command to draw this cluster should be emitted by this shader
invocation for further rendering processing.
There are two types of drawing command, indexed mode and non-indexed mode.
Both type of drawing commands consist of a set of built-in output variables
which have a similar definition to slink:VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand and
slink:VkDrawIndirectCommand members.

Cluster culling shaders have the following built-in output variables:

  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>> code:IndexCountHUAWEI
    is the number of vertices to draw.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>>
    code:VertexCountHUAWEI is the number of vertices to draw.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>>
    code:InstanceCountHUAWEI is the number of instances to draw.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>> code:FirstIndexHUAWEI
    is the base index within the index buffer.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>>
    code:FirstVertexHUAWEI is the index of the first vertex to draw
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>>
    code:VertexOffsetHUAWEI is the value added to the vertex index before
    indexing into the vertex buffer.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>>
    code:FirstInstanceHUAWEI is the instance ID of the first instance to
    draw.
  * <<interfaces-builtin-variables,built-in variable>> code:ClusterIDHUAWEI
    is the index of cluster being rendered by this drawing command.
    When cluster culling shader is enabled, code:ClusterIDHUAWEI will
    replace code:gl_DrawID pass to vertex shader.


[[cluster-culling-cluster-ordering]]
== Cluster Culling Shader Cluster Ordering

  * When a cluster culling shader is used, all output clusters generated by
    code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI() in a given workgroup are passed to
    subsequent pipeline stage before any cluster generated from subsequent
    workgroup.
  * In a workgroup, the order of output clusters generated by
    code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI() is specified by the local invocation id,
    from lower to higher values.
  * If any cluster culling invocation in the workgroup does not call
    code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI(), no cluster will be sent to the subsequent
    rendering pipeline.
  * Any cluster culling shader invocation may also call
    code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI() many times as shown below:

[source,c]
----
// Cluster Culling Shader sample code:
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 0
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 1
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 2
        ......
----

In this case, the output sequence of clusters in a workgroup are specified
as shown below ( in case of 32 shader invocations in a workgroup):

[source,c]
----
1. shader invocation0.dispatch0
2. shader invocation1.dispatch0,
            ..........
32. shader invocation31.dispatch0
33. shader invocation0.dispatch1
34. shader invocation1.dispatch1
            ..........
64. shader invocation31.dispatch1
65. shader invocation0.dispatch2
66. shader invocation1.dispatch2
            ..........
96. shader Invocation31.dispatch2

[[cluster-culling-primitive-ordering]]
== Cluster Culling Shader Primitive Ordering

Following guarantees are provided for the relative ordering of primitives
produced by a cluster culling shader, as they pertain to
<<drawing-primitive-order,primitive order>>.

  * Limited guarantees are provided for the relative ordering of primitives
    produced by a cluster culling shader, as they pertain to primitive
    order.
  * The order of primitives in a given cluster is specified by the content
    of
  ** code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI() with indexed output built-in variables,
     vertices sourced from a lower index buffer addresses to higher
     addresses.
  ** code:DispatchClusterHUAWEI() with non-indexed output built-in
     variables, from vertices with a lower numbered vertexIndex to a higher
     numbered vertexIndex.
