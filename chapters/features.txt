= Features

_Features_ describe functionality which is not supported on all
implementations.
Features are properties of the physical device.
Features are optional:, and must: be explicitly enabled before use.
Support for features is reported and enabled on a per-feature basis.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
[NOTE]
.Note
====
Features are reported via the basic slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
structure, as well as the extensible structure
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2, which was added in the
`<<VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2>>` extension and included in
Vulkan 1.1.
When new features are added in future Vulkan versions or extensions, each
extension should: introduce one new feature structure, if needed.
This structure can: be added to the pname:pNext chain of the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 structure.
====
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

For convenience, new core versions of Vulkan may: introduce new unified
features structures for features promoted from extensions.
At the same time, the extension's original features structure (if any) is
also promoted to the core API, and is an alias of the extension's structure.
This results in multiple names for the same feature: in the original
extension's feature structure and the promoted structure alias, in the
unified feature structure.
When a feature was implicitly supported and enabled in the extension, but an
explicit name was added during promotion, then the extension itself acts as
an alias for the feature as listed in the table below.

All aliases of the same feature in the core API must: be reported
consistently: either all must: be reported as supported, or none of them.
When a promoted extension is available, any corresponding feature aliases
must: be supported.

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    structure in which the physical device features are returned.
    For each feature, a value of ename:VK_TRUE specifies that the feature is
    supported on this physical device, and ename:VK_FALSE specifies that the
    feature is not supported.

Fine-grained features used by a logical device must: be enabled at
sname:VkDevice creation time.
If a feature is enabled that the physical device does not support,
sname:VkDevice creation will fail and return
ename:VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT.

The fine-grained features are enabled by passing a pointer to the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure via the pname:pEnabledFeatures
member of the slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure that is passed into the
fname:vkCreateDevice call.
If a member of pname:pEnabledFeatures is set to ename:VK_TRUE or
ename:VK_FALSE, then the device will be created with the indicated feature
enabled or disabled, respectively.
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
Features can: also be enabled by using the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2
structure.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

If an application wishes to enable all features supported by a device, it
can: simply pass in the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure that was
previously returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.
To disable an individual feature, the application can: set the desired
member to ename:VK_FALSE in the same structure.
Setting pname:pEnabledFeatures to `NULL`
ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
and not including a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 in the pname:pNext chain
of slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1,VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
is equivalent to setting all members of the structure to ename:VK_FALSE.

====
Some features, such as pname:robustBufferAccess, may: incur a runtime
performance cost.
Application writers should: carefully consider the implications of enabling
all supported features.

  * [[features-robustBufferAccess]] pname:robustBufferAccess specifies that
    accesses to buffers are bounds-checked against the range of the buffer
    descriptor (as determined by sname:VkDescriptorBufferInfo::pname:range,
    slink:VkBufferViewCreateInfo::pname:range, or the size of the buffer).
    Out of bounds accesses must: not cause application termination, and the
    effects of shader loads, stores, and atomics must: conform to an
    implementation-dependent behavior as described below.
  ** A buffer access is considered to be out of bounds if any of the
     following are true:
  *** The pointer was formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the coordinate
      is less than zero or greater than or equal to the number of whole
      elements in the bound range.
  *** The pointer was not formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the object
      pointed to is not wholly contained within the bound range.

      This includes accesses performed via _variable pointers_ where the
      buffer descriptor being accessed cannot be statically determined.
      Uninitialized pointers and pointers equal to code:OpConstantNull are
      treated as pointing to a zero-sized object, so all accesses through

      access of the same type (load, store, or atomic) to the same buffer

      bounds address may: also be considered out of bounds.
  *** If the access is a load that reads from the same memory locations as a

      instruction, even if the access is out of bounds.

      the appropriate out of bounds value.
ifdef::VK_EXT_robustness2[]
  ** Accesses to descriptors written with a dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE resource or

====
The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT structure was added

Version 1 implementations of this extension will not fill out the features
structure but applications may assume that both pname:subgroupSizeControl

(See also the <<features-requirements, Feature Requirements>> section.)
Applications are advised to add a
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT structure to the
pname:pNext chain of slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo to enable the features
regardless of the version of the extension supported by the implementation.
If the implementation only supports version 1, it will safely ignore the
