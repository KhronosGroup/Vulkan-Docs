== Indirect Commands Layout

The device-side command generation happens through an iterative processing
of an atomic sequence comprised of command tokens, which are represented by:

ifdef::VK_EXT_device_generated_commands[]
[open,refpage='VkIndirectCommandsLayoutEXT',desc='Opaque handle to an indirect commands layout object',type='handles']
--
include::{generated}/api/handles/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutEXT.adoc[]
--
endif::VK_EXT_device_generated_commands[]

ifdef::VK_EXT_device_generated_commands+VK_NV_device_generated_commands[or:]

ifdef::VK_NV_device_generated_commands[]

--
include::{generated}/api/handles/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNV.adoc[]
--
endif::VK_NV_device_generated_commands[]

Each indirect command layout must: have exactly one action command token and
it must: be the last token in the sequence.

[NOTE]
====
If the indirect commands layout contains only 1 token, it will be an action
command token, and the contents of the indirect buffer will be a sequence of
indirect command structures, similar to the ones used for indirect draws and
dispatches.
On some implementations, using indirect draws and dispatches for these cases
will result in increased performance compared to using device-generated
commands, due to the overhead that results from using the latter.

Indirect command layouts for `apiext:VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` are
created by:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateIndirectCommandsLayoutEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the indirect command
    layout.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoEXT structure containing
    parameters affecting creation of the indirect command layout.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pIndirectCommandsLayout is a pointer to a
    sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutEXT handle in which the resulting indirect
    command layout is returned.

.Valid Usage

    The <<features-deviceGeneratedCommandsEXT,
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsFeaturesEXT::pname:deviceGeneratedCommands>>
    feature must: be enabled

[open,refpage='VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoEXT',desc='Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created indirect commands layout object',type='structs']

The sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoEXT.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of
    elink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutUsageFlagBitsEXT specifying usage rules
    for this layout.
  * pname:shaderStages is the tlink:VkShaderStageFlags that this layout
    supports.
  * pname:indirectStride is the distance in bytes between sequences in the
    indirect buffer
  * pname:pipelineLayout is the optional slink:VkPipelineLayout that tokens
    in this layout use.
    If the <<features-dynamicGeneratedPipelineLayout,
    pname:dynamicGeneratedPipelineLayout>> feature is enabled,
    pname:pipelineLayout can: be dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE and the layout must:
    be specified by chaining the slink:VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo structure
    off the pname:pNext
  * pname:tokenCount is the length of the individual command sequence.
  * pname:pTokens is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenEXT describing each command token in
    detail.

The following code illustrates some of the flags:

[source,c]
----
void cmdProcessAllSequences(cmd, indirectExecutionSet, indirectCommandsLayout, indirectAddress, sequencesCount)
{
  for (s = 0; s < sequencesCount; s++)
  {
    sUsed = s;

    if (indirectCommandsLayout.flags & VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_UNORDERED_SEQUENCES_BIT_EXT) {
      sUsed = incoherent_implementation_dependent_permutation[ sUsed ];
    }

    cmdProcessSequence( cmd, indirectExecutionSet, indirectCommandsLayout, indirectAddress, sUsed );
  }
}
----

When tokens are consumed, an offset is computed based on token offset and
stream stride.
The resulting offset is required to be aligned.
The alignment for a specific token is equal to the scalar alignment of the
data type as defined in <<interfaces-alignment-requirements,Alignment
Requirements>>, or `4`, whichever is lower.

  * pname:streamCount is the number of streams used to provide the token

  * pname:pStreamStrides is an array defining the byte stride for each input

The following code illustrates some of the flags:

A pname:minIndirectCommandsBufferOffsetAlignment of 4 allows

This enables direct compatibility with D3D12 command signature layouts.

=== Tokenized Command Processing

ifdef::VK_EXT_device_generated_commands[]
The processing for `apiext:VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` is in principle
illustrated below:

[source,c]
----
void cmdProcessSequence(cmd, indirectExecutionSet, indirectCommandsLayout, indirectAddress, s)
{
  for (t = 0; t < indirectCommandsLayout.tokenCount; t++)
  {
    uint32_t offset  = indirectCommandsLayout.pTokens[t].offset;
    uint32_t stride  = indirectCommandsLayout.indirectStride;
    VkDeviceAddress streamData = indirectAddress;
    const void* input = streamData + stride * s + offset;

    // further details later
    indirectCommandsLayout.pTokens[t].command (cmd, indirectExecutionSet, input, s);
  }
}

void cmdProcessAllSequences(cmd, indirectExecutionSet, indirectCommandsLayout, indirectAddress, sequencesCount)
{
  for (s = 0; s < sequencesCount; s++)
  {
    sUsed = s;

    if (indirectCommandsLayout.flags & VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_UNORDERED_SEQUENCES_BIT_EXT) {
      sUsed = incoherent_implementation_dependent_permutation[ sUsed ];
    }

    cmdProcessSequence( cmd, indirectExecutionSet, indirectCommandsLayout, indirectAddress, sUsed );
  }
}
----

The processing of each sequence is considered stateless, therefore all state
changes must: occur prior to action commands within the sequence.
A single sequence is strictly targeting the tlink:VkShaderStageFlags it was
created with.

The primary input data for each token is provided through sname:VkBuffer
content at preprocessing using flink:vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsEXT or
execution time using flink:vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT, however some
functional arguments, for example push constant layouts, are specified at
layout creation time.
The input size is different for each token.

Possible values of those elements of the
slink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoEXT::pname:pTokens array specifying
command tokens (other elements of the array specify command parameters) are:

The processing of each sequence is considered stateless, therefore all state
changes must: occur before any action command tokens within the sequence.
A single sequence is strictly targeting the elink:VkPipelineBindPoint it was
created with.

The primary input data for each token is provided through sname:VkBuffer
content at preprocessing using flink:vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsNV or
execution time using flink:vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsNV, however some
functional arguments, for example binding sets, are specified at layout
creation time.
The input size is different for each token.
