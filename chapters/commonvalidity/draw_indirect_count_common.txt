// Common Valid Usage
// Common to indirect drawing commands with a pname:countBuffer parameter
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-countBuffer-02714]]
    If pname:countBuffer is non-sparse then it must: be bound completely and
    contiguously to a single sname:VkDeviceMemory object
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-countBuffer-02715]]
    pname:countBuffer must: have been created with the
    ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDIRECT_BUFFER_BIT bit set
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-countBufferOffset-02716]]
    pname:countBufferOffset must: be a multiple of `4`
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-countBuffer-02717]]
    The count stored in pname:countBuffer must: be less than or equal to
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:maxDrawIndirectCount
