  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-07461]]
    For each pname:pInfos[i], pname:dstMicromap must: have been created with
    a value of slink:VkMicromapCreateInfoEXT::pname:size greater than or
    equal to the memory size required by the build operation, as returned by
    flink:vkGetMicromapBuildSizesEXT with [eq]#pname:pBuildInfo =
    pname:pInfos[i]#
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-mode-07462]]
    The pname:mode member of each element of pname:pInfos must: be a valid
    elink:VkBuildMicromapModeEXT value
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-dstMicromap-07463]]
    The pname:dstMicromap member of any element of pname:pInfos must: be a
    valid slink:VkMicromapEXT handle
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-07464]]
    For each element of pname:pInfos its pname:type member must: match the
    value of slink:VkMicromapCreateInfoEXT::pname:type when its
    pname:dstMicromap was created
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-dstMicromap-07465]]
    The range of memory backing the pname:dstMicromap member of any element
    of pname:pInfos that is accessed by this command must: not overlap the
    memory backing the pname:dstMicromap member of any other element of
    pname:pInfos, which is accessed by this command
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-dstMicromap-07466]]
    The range of memory backing the pname:dstMicromap member of any element
    of pname:pInfos that is accessed by this command must: not overlap the
    memory backing the pname:scratchData member of any element of
    pname:pInfos (including the same element), which is accessed by this
    command
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-scratchData-07467]]
    The range of memory backing the pname:scratchData member of any element
    of pname:pInfos that is accessed by this command must: not overlap the
    memory backing the pname:scratchData member of any other element of
    pname:pInfos, which is accessed by this command
