    sname:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo structure specified when creating the
    sname:VkPipeline bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS

    The subpass index of the current render pass must: be equal to the

    specified when creating the sname:VkPipeline bound to
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS

    Every input attachment used by the current subpass must: be bound to the
    pipeline via a descriptor set

    Image subresources used as attachments in the current render pass must:
    not be accessed in any way other than as an attachment by this command
