// Common Valid Usage
// Common to drawing commands that consume vertex binding state
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-None-02720]]
    All vertex input bindings accessed via vertex input variables declared
    in the vertex shader entry point's interface must: have valid buffers
    bound
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-None-02721]]
    For a given vertex buffer binding, any attribute data fetched must: be
    entirely contained within the corresponding vertex buffer binding, as
    described in <<fxvertex-input>>
