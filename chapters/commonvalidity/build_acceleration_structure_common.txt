// Common Valid Usage
// Common to acceleration structure build commands

  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pOffsetInfos-03402]]
    Each element of pname:ppOffsetInfos[i] must: be a valid pointer to an
    array of pname:pInfos[i].pname:geometryCount
    sname:VkAccelerationStructureBuildOffsetInfoKHR structures
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-03403]]
    Each pname:pInfos[i].pname:srcAccelerationStructure must: not refer to
    the same acceleration structure as any
    pname:pInfos[i].pname:dstAccelerationStructure that is provided to the
    same build command unless it is identical for an update
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-03404]]
    For each pname:pInfos[i], pname:dstAccelerationStructure must: have been
    created with compatible slink:VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR where
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR::pname:type and
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR::pname:flags are identical to
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR::pname:type and
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR::pname:flags
    respectively,
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR::pname:geometryCount
    for pname:dstAccelerationStructure are greater than or equal to the
    build size, and each geometry in
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR::pname:ppGeometries
    for pname:dstAccelerationStructure has greater than or equal to the
    number of vertices, indices, and AABBs,
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR::pname:transformData
    is both 0 or both non-zero, and all other parameters are the same
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-03405]]
    For each pname:pInfos[i], if pname:update is ename:VK_TRUE, then objects
    that were previously active for that acceleration structure must: not be
    made inactive as per <<acceleration-structure-inactive-prims>>
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-03406]]
    For each pname:pInfos[i], if pname:update is ename:VK_TRUE, then objects
    that were previously inactive for that acceleration structure must: not
    be made active as per <<acceleration-structure-inactive-prims>>
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-None-03407]]
    Any acceleration structure instance in any top level build in this
    command must: not reference any bottom level acceleration structure
    built by this command
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-pInfos-03408]]
    There must: not be any <<resources-memory-aliasing, memory aliasing>>
    between the scratch memories that are provided in all the
    pname:pInfos[i].pname:scratchData memories for the acceleration
    structure builds
  * [[VUID-{refpage}-None-03409]]
    There must: not be any <<resources-memory-aliasing, memory aliasing>>
    between memory bound to any top level, bottom level, or instance
    acceleration structure accessed by this command
