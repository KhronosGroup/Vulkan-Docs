==== QNX Screen Buffer

The QNX SDP defines code:_screen_buffer objects, which represent
a buffer that the QNX Screen graphics subsystem can use directly
in its windowing system APIs. More specifically, a Screen buffer is an area of memory that
stores pixel data. It can be attached to Screen windows, streams, or pixmaps.
These QNX Screen buffer objects may: be imported into
slink:VkDeviceMemory objects for access via Vulkan.
An slink:VkImage or slink:VkBuffer can: be bound to the imported
slink:VkDeviceMemory object if it is created with
ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_SCREEN_BUFFER_BIT_QNX.

--
code:struct code:_screen_buffer is strongly typed, so naming the handle type is
redundant. The internal layout and therefore size of a code:struct code:_screen_buffer
image may depend on native usage flags that do not have corresponding Vulkan
counterparts.

[[memory-external-screen-buffer-validity]]
===== QNX Screen Buffer Validity
The design of Screen in the QNX SDP makes it difficult to determine the validity of objects from outside of Screen. Therefore, applications must: ensure that QNX Screen buffer objects provided used in various Vulkan
interfaces are ones created explicitly with QNX Screen APIs. See QNX SDP documentation for more information.

A slink:VkDeviceMemory imported from a QNX Screen buffer has no way to acquire
a reference to its code:_screen_buffer object. Therefore, during the host
execution of a Vulkan command that has a QNX Screen buffer as a parameter
(including indirect parameters via pname:pNext chains), the application must:
ensure that the QNX Screen buffer resource remains valid.

Generally, for a code:_screen_buffer object to be valid for use within a Vulkan implementation, the buffer object
should: have a code:_screen_buffer::code:SCREEN_PROPERTY_USAGE that includes at least one of:
code:SCREEN_USAGE_VULKAN, code:SCREEN_USAGE_OPENGL_ES2, code:SCREEN_USAGE_OPENGL_ES3, or code:SCREEN_USAGE_NATIVE.
The exact Screen-native usage flags required depends on the Vulkan implementation, and QNX Screen itself will not necessarily enforce these requirements. Note that Screen-native usage flags are in no way related to usage flags in the Vulkan specification.

[[memory-external-screen-buffer-external-formats]]
===== QNX Screen Buffer External Formats

QNX Screen buffers may: represent images using implementation-specific
formats, layouts, color models, etc., which do not have Vulkan equivalents.
Such _external formats_ are commonly used by external image sources such as
video decoders or cameras.
Vulkan can: import QNX Screen buffers that have external formats, but
since the image contents are in an undiscoverable and possibly proprietary
representation, images with external formats must: only be used as sampled
images, must: only be sampled with a sampler that has {YCbCr} conversion
enabled, and must: have optimal tiling.

Images that will be backed by a QNX Screen buffer can: use an
external format by setting slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:format to
ename:VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED and including a slink:VkExternalFormatQNX
structure in the pname:pNext chain.
Images can: be created with an external format even if the QNX Screen
buffer has a format which has an
<<memory-external-qnx-screen-buffer-formats,equivalent Vulkan format>>
to enable consistent handling of images from sources that might use either
category of format.
The external format of a QNX Screen buffer can: be obtained by
passing a slink:VkScreenBufferFormatPropertiesQNX structure to
flink:vkGetScreenBufferPropertiesQNX.


[[memory-external-qnx-screen-buffer-image-resources]]
===== QNX Screen Buffer Image Resources

QNX Screen buffers have intrinsic width, height, format, and usage
properties, so Vulkan images bound to memory imported from a QNX Screen
buffer must: use dedicated allocations:
sname:VkMemoryDedicatedRequirements::pname:requiresDedicatedAllocation must:
be ename:VK_TRUE for images created with
slink:VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo::pname:handleTypes that includes
ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_SCREEN_BUFFER_BIT_QNX.
When creating an image that will be bound to an imported QNX Screen buffer,
the image creation parameters must: be equivalent to the
code:_screen_buffer properties as described by the valid usage of
slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo.

1::
    Vulkan does not differentiate between
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBA8888 and
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX8888: they both behave as
    ename:VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM.
    After an external entity writes to a
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX8888 QNX Screen buffer, the
    values read by Vulkan from the X/A component are undefined:.
    To emulate the traditional behavior of the X component during sampling
    or blending, applications should: use ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_ONE in
    image view component mappings and ename:VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE in color
    blend factors.
    There is no way to avoid copying these undefined: values when copying
    from such an image to another image or buffer.
    The same behavior applies to the following pairs: code:SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRA8888 and
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRX8888, code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBA1010102 and
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX1010102, code:SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRA1010102 and
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRX1010102, code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBA5551 and
    code:SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX5551
