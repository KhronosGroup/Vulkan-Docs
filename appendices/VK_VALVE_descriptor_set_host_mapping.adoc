=== Description

This extension allows applications to directly query a host pointer for a
slink:VkDescriptorSet which can: be used to copy descriptors between
descriptor sets without the use of an API command.
Memory offsets and sizes for descriptors can: be queried from a
slink:VkDescriptorSetLayout as well.
