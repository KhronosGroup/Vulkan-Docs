in SPIR-V shader modules.

include::{generated}/interfaces/VK_KHR_shader_non_semantic_info.adoc[]

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.3

Functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.3 Because the
extension has no API controlling its functionality, this results only in a
change to the <<spirvenv-extensions-table, SPIR-V Extensions table>>.
