=== Description

This extension adds the device coherent and device uncached memory types.
Any device accesses to device coherent memory are automatically made visible
to any other device access.
Device uncached memory indicates to applications that caches are disabled
for a particular memory type, which guarantees device coherence.

Device coherent and uncached memory are expected to have lower performance
for general access than non-device coherent memory, but can be useful in
certain scenarios; particularly so for debugging.
