=== Description

This extension allows the use of a null constant initializer on shader
Workgroup memory variables, allowing implementations to expose any special
hardware or instructions they may have.
Zero initialization is commonly used by applications running untrusted
content (e.g. web browsers) as way of defeating memory-scraping attacks.

Functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.3, with the KHR
suffix omitted.

the core functionality.
