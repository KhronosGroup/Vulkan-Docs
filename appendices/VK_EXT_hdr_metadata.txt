This extension defines two new structures and a function to assign SMPTE
(the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) 2086 metadata and
CTA (Consumer Technology Assocation) 861.3 metadata to a swapchain.
The metadata includes the color primaries, white point, and luminance range
of the mastering display, which all together define the color volume that
contains all the possible colors the mastering display can produce.
The mastering display is the display where creative work is done and
creative intent is established.
To preserve such creative intent as much as possible and achieve consistent
color reproduction on different viewing displays, it is useful for the
display pipeline to know the color volume of the original mastering display
where content was created or tuned.
This avoids performing unnecessary mapping of colors that are not
displayable on the original mastering display.
The metadata also includes the pname:maxContentLightLevel and
pname:maxFrameAverageLightLevel as defined by CTA 861.3.

While the general purpose of the metadata is to assist in the transformation
between different color volumes of different displays and help achieve
better color reproduction, it is not in the scope of this extension to
define how exactly the metadata should be used in such a process.
It is up to the implementation to determine how to make use of the metadata.

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending elink:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_HDR_METADATA_EXT

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkXYColorEXT
  * slink:VkHdrMetadataEXT

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkSetHdrMetadataEXT

=== Issues

1) Do we need a query function?

*PROPOSED*: No, Vulkan does not provide queries for state that the
application can track on its own.

2) Should we specify default if not specified by the application?

*PROPOSED*: No, that leaves the default up to the display.
