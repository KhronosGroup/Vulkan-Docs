=== Description

A memory barrier may: have a performance penalty when acquiring ownership of
a subresource range from an external queue family.
This extension provides API that may: reduce the performance penalty if
ownership of the subresource range was previously released to the external
queue family and if the resource's memory has remained unmodified between
the release and acquire operations.
