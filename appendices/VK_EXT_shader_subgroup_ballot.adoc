=== Description

This extension adds support for the following SPIR-V extension in Vulkan:

  * `SPV_KHR_shader_ballot`

This extension provides the ability for a group of invocations, which
execute in parallel, to do limited forms of cross-invocation communication
via a group broadcast of an invocation value, or broadcast of a bit array
representing a predicate value from each invocation in the group.

This extension provides access to a number of additional built-in shader
variables in Vulkan:

  * code:SubgroupEqMaskKHR, containing the subgroup mask of the current
    subgroup invocation,
  * code:SubgroupGeMaskKHR, containing the subgroup mask of the invocations
    greater than or equal to the current invocation,
  * code:SubgroupGtMaskKHR, containing the subgroup mask of the invocations
    greater than the current invocation,
  * code:SubgroupLeMaskKHR, containing the subgroup mask of the invocations
    less than or equal to the current invocation,
  * code:SubgroupLtMaskKHR, containing the subgroup mask of the invocations
    less than the current invocation,
  * code:SubgroupLocalInvocationId, containing the index of an invocation
    within a subgroup, and
  * code:SubgroupSize, containing the maximum number of invocations in a
    subgroup.

Additionally, this extension provides access to the new SPIR-V instructions:

  * code:OpSubgroupBallotKHR,
  * code:OpSubgroupFirstInvocationKHR, and
  * code:OpSubgroupReadInvocationKHR,

When using GLSL source-based shader languages, the following variables and
shader functions from GL_ARB_shader_ballot can map to these SPIR-V built-in
decorations and instructions:

  * `in uint64_t gl_SubGroupEqMaskARB;` -> code:SubgroupEqMaskKHR,
  * `in uint64_t gl_SubGroupGeMaskARB;` -> code:SubgroupGeMaskKHR,
  * `in uint64_t gl_SubGroupGtMaskARB;` -> code:SubgroupGtMaskKHR,
  * `in uint64_t gl_SubGroupLeMaskARB;` -> code:SubgroupLeMaskKHR,
  * `in uint64_t gl_SubGroupLtMaskARB;` -> code:SubgroupLtMaskKHR,
  * `in uint gl_SubGroupInvocationARB;` -> code:SubgroupLocalInvocationId,
  * `uniform uint gl_SubGroupSizeARB;` -> code:SubgroupSize,
  * code:ballotARB() -> code:OpSubgroupBallotKHR,
  * code:readFirstInvocationARB() -> code:OpSubgroupFirstInvocationKHR, and
  * code:readInvocationARB() -> code:OpSubgroupReadInvocationKHR.

=== Deprecated by Vulkan 1.2

Most of the functionality in this extension is superseded by the core Vulkan
1.1 <<VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties, subgroup operations>>.
However, Vulkan 1.1 required the code:OpGroupNonUniformBroadcast "`Id`" to
be constant.
This restriction was removed in Vulkan 1.2 with the addition of the
<<features-subgroupBroadcastDynamicId, pname:subgroupBroadcastDynamicId>>
feature.
