=== Description

This extension provides new entry points to query memory requirements of
images and buffers in a way that can be easily extended by other extensions,
without introducing any further entry points.
The Vulkan 1.0 slink:VkMemoryRequirements and
slink:VkSparseImageMemoryRequirements structures do not include pname:sType
and pname:pNext members.
This extension wraps them in new structures with these members, so an
application can query a chain of memory requirements structures by
constructing the chain and letting the implementation fill them in.
A new command is added for each ftext:vkGet*MemoryRequrements command in
core Vulkan 1.0.

=== New Object Types

None.

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending elink:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_INFO_2_KHR
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_INFO_2_KHR
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_SPARSE_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_INFO_2_KHR
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_2_KHR
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SPARSE_IMAGE_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_2_KHR

=== New Enums

None.

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkBufferMemoryRequirementsInfo2KHR
  * slink:VkImageMemoryRequirementsInfo2KHR
  * slink:VkImageSparseMemoryRequirementsInfo2KHR
  * slink:VkMemoryRequirements2KHR
  * slink:VkSparseImageMemoryRequirements2KHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkGetImageMemoryRequirements2KHR
  * flink:vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2KHR
  * flink:vkGetImageSparseMemoryRequirements2KHR

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.

=== Issues

None.
