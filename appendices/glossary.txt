Specification and may be used with or without capitalization.

    included in the pname:stageFlags of the descriptor binding.
    Descriptors using that binding can: only be used by stages in which they
    are accessible.

Acquire Operation (Resource)::
    An operation that acquires ownership of an image subresource or buffer
    range.

    primitive, but is accessible in geometry shaders.

    A range of a device memory allocation that is bound to multiple
    resources simultaneously.

Allocation Scope::
    An association of a host memory allocation to a parent object or
    command, where the allocation's lifetime ends before or at the same time
    as the parent object is freed or destroyed, or during the parent
    command.

Aspect (Image)::
    An image may: contain multiple kinds, or aspects, of data for each
    pixel, where each aspect is used in a particular way by the pipeline and
    may: be stored differently or separately from other aspects.
    For example, the color components of an image format make up the color
    aspect of the image, and may: be used as a framebuffer color attachment.
    Some operations, like depth testing, operate only on specific aspects of
    an image.

    at a time.

    accesses to become available for future access.

Backwards Compatibility::
    A given version of the API is backwards compatible with an earlier
    version if an application, relying only on valid behavior and

    detects a different version.

Full Compatibility::
    A given version of the API is fully compatible with another version if
    an application, relying only on valid behavior and functionality defined
    by either of those specifications, is able to correctly run against each
    version without any modification.

    detects a different version.
