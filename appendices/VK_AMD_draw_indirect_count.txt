=== Description

This extension allows an application to source the number of draw calls for
indirect draw calls from a buffer.
This enables applications to generate arbitrary amounts of draw commands and
execute them without host intervention.

=== Promotion to `VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count`

All functionality in this extension is included in
`<<VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count>>`, with the suffix changed to KHR.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
