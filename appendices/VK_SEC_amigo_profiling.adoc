=== Description

This extension is intended to communicate information from layered API
implementations such as ANGLE to internal proprietary system schedulers.
It has no behavioural implications beyond enabling more intelligent
behaviour from the system scheduler.

Application developers should avoid using this extension.
It is documented solely for the benefit of tools and layer developers, who
may need to manipulate pname:pNext chains that include these structures.
