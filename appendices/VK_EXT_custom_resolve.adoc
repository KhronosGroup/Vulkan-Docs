=== Description

This extension provides functionality for using shaders to resolve
multisample rendering attachments.

It builds upon mechanics introduced by VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve,
additionally adding support for dynamic rendering.

=== Issues

1) How will this work with shader objects?

Some vendors emit an epilog at the end of the FS that stores each
color/depth/stencil attachment to the appropriate tilebuffer location, and
to do that they need to know the layout of the tilebuffer which depends on
the attachment formats/sample counts.
We agreed that for shader object the FS epilog is emitted dynamically when
the draw happens.
