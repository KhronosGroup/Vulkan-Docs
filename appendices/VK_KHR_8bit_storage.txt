The +VK_KHR_8bit_storage+ extension allows use of 8-bit types in uniform and
storage buffers, and push constant blocks.
This extension introduces several new optional features which map to SPIR-V
capabilities and allow access to 8-bit data in code:Block-decorated objects
in the code:Uniform and the code:StorageBuffer storage classes, and objects
in the code:PushConstant storage class.

The code:StorageBuffer8BitAccess capability must: be supported by all
implementations of this extension.
The other capabilities are optional.
