include::{generated}/interfaces/VK_FOOL_printed_surface.txt[]

=== Issues

Tons of them.

1) What vendor string should be used for this extension?


2) What should this extension be named?

*RESOLVED*: VK_*_printed_surface, to ensure that we don't box ourselves in on
            the medium that the swapchain images are being printed onto.


3) Should this extension be made platform specificby introducing a dependency on CUPS?


4) Fax machines share similar base functionality with printers. Will they be supported by this extension?


5) Printers are inherintly complex devices which are not yet fully understood
   by humanity, does the current set of error codes available in Vulkan allow
   for implementations to adequately express the various states of disarray
   encountered when a print is not successful?


6) Will this extension support printers with limited character set support,
   such as teleprinters?


7) Typicaly swapchain image count requirements are subject to presentation
   hardware and are queried at initialization-time. Will this conflict with the
   reality of dwindling page count?


8) Why would someone want to see a printed frame?


9) Pre-existing surface implementations would account for surfaceFormat which
   is confusingly names as it actually represnts the surface color format,
   rather than the medium of the presentation surface itself. Will this
   extesnion carry that precedent in light of mulitple supported types of
   surface medium? ie: Paper, cardboard, fabric


10) Is elongated swapchain backpressure from image acquisition a concern for
    the practicality of apps wishing to implement this extension?


11) How will duplex printing be handled?


12) Should this extension specify features available in high-end printers such as autmatic stapling and hole punching?


13) Will priority in the print queue be handled by this extension?

*RESOLVED*: Please wait for the VK_FOOL_print_queue_priority extension.


14) Will this extension support printing "zoom levels"? Possibly allowing multiple presented images to appear on a single page?


15) Are print color profiles covered under the scope of this extension?


16) Why are you doing this?


17) How does this extension interact with partial present?


18) How does this extension interact with overlay layers (such as MangoHUD)?


19) How will this extension interact with HDR images?


20) Is this a serious extension?

*RESOLVED*: No, why? Do you want it to be?
