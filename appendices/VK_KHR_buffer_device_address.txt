=== Description

This extension allows the application to query a 64-bit buffer device
address value for a buffer, which can be used to access the buffer memory
via the code:PhysicalStorageBuffer storage class in the
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/ext/GLSL_EXT_buffer_reference.txt[`GL_EXT_buffer_reference`]
GLSL extension and
{spirv}/KHR/SPV_KHR_physical_storage_buffer.html[`SPV_KHR_physical_storage_buffer`]
SPIR-V extension.

This extension also allows opaque addresses for buffers and memory objects
to be queried and later supplied by a trace capture and replay tool, so that
addresses used at replay time match the addresses used when the trace was
captured.
To enable tools to insert these queries, new memory allocation flags must be
specified for memory objects that will be bound to buffers accessed via the
code:PhysicalStorageBuffer storage class.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.2

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.2, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
However, if Vulkan 1.2 is supported and this extension is not, the
code:bufferDeviceAddress capability is optional.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
