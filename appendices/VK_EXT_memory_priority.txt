This extension adds a pname:priority value specified at memory allocation
time.
On some systems with both device-local and non-device-local memory heaps,
the implementation may transparently move memory from one heap to another
when a heap becomes full (for example, when the total memory used across all
processes exceeds the size of the heap).
In such a case, this priority value may be used to determine which
allocations are more likely to remain in device-local memory.
