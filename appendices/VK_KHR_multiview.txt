=== Description

This extension has the same goal as the OpenGL ES `GL_OVR_multiview`
extension - it enables rendering to multiple "`views`" by recording a single
set of commands to be executed with slightly different behavior for each
view.
It includes a concise way to declare a render pass with multiple views, and
gives implementations freedom to render the views in the most efficient way
possible.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
