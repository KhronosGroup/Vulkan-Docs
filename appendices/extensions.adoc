= Layers & Extensions (Informative)

Extensions to the Vulkan API can: be defined by authors, groups of authors,
and the Khronos Vulkan
ifdef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[Safety Critical]
Working Group.
In order not to compromise the readability of the Vulkan Specification, the
core Specification does not incorporate most extensions.
The online Registry of extensions is available at URL

ifndef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/]
ifdef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[https://registry.khronos.org/vulkansc/]

and allows generating versions of the Specification incorporating different
extensions.

Authors creating extensions and layers must: follow the mandatory procedures
described in the <<vulkan-styleguide, Vulkan Documentation and Extensions>>
document when creating extensions and layers.

The remainder of this appendix documents a set of extensions chosen when
this document was built.
Versions of the Specification published in the Registry include:

  * Core API + mandatory extensions required of all Vulkan implementations.
ifndef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
  * Core API + all registered and published Khronos (`KHR`) extensions.
endif::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
  * Core API + all registered and published extensions.

Extensions are grouped as Khronos `KHR`, multivendor `EXT`, and then
alphabetically by author ID.
Within each group, extensions are listed in alphabetical order by their
name.


== Extension Dependencies

Extensions which have dependencies on specific core versions or on other
extensions will list such dependencies.

For core versions, the specified version must be supported at runtime.
All extensions implicitly require support for Vulkan 1.0.

For a device extension, use of any device-level functionality defined by
that extension requires that any extensions that extension depends on be
enabled.

For any extension, use of any instance-level functionality defined by that
extension requires only that any extensions that extension depends on be
supported at runtime.


== Extension Interactions

Some extensions define APIs which are only supported when other extensions
or core versions are supported at runtime.
Such interactions are noted as "`API Interactions`".
