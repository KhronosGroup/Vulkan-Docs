=== Description

This extension adds a new elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits2KHR 64bits format
feature flag type to extend the existing elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits which
is limited to 31 flags.
At the time of this writing 29 bits of elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits are
already used.

Because slink:VkFormatProperties2 is already defined to extend the Vulkan
1.0 flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties entry point, this extension
defines a new slink:VkFormatProperties3KHR to extend the
slink:VkFormatProperties.

On top of replicating all the bits from elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits,
elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits2KHR adds the following bits :

  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_STORAGE_READ_WITHOUT_FORMAT_BIT_KHR and
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_STORAGE_WRITE_WITHOUT_FORMAT_BIT_KHR indicate
    that an implementation supports respectively reading and writing a given
    elink:VkFormat through storage operations without specifying the format
    in the shader.

  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_SAMPLED_IMAGE_DEPTH_COMPARISON_BIT_KHR
    indicates that an implementation supports depth comparison performed by
    code:OpImage*Dref instructions on a given elink:VkFormat.
    Previously the result of executing a code:OpImage*Dref* instruction on
    an image view, where the pname:format was not one of the depth/stencil
    formats with a depth component, was undefined.
    This bit clarifies on which formats such instructions can be used.
