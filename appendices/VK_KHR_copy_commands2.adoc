=== Description

This extension provides extensible versions of the Vulkan buffer and image
copy commands.
The new commands are functionally identical to the core commands, except
that their copy parameters are specified using extensible structures that
can be used to pass extension-specific information.

The following extensible copy commands are introduced with this extension:
flink:vkCmdCopyBuffer2KHR, flink:vkCmdCopyImage2KHR,
flink:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage2KHR, flink:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer2KHR,
flink:vkCmdBlitImage2KHR, and flink:vkCmdResolveImage2KHR.
Each command contains an stext:*Info2KHR structure parameter that includes
ptext:sType/ptext:pNext members.
Lower level structures describing each region to be copied are also extended
with ptext:sType/ptext:pNext members.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.3

Functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.3, with the KHR
suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
