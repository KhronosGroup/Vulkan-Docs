The `VK_KHR_android_surface` extension is an instance extension.
It provides a mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by
the `<<VK_KHR_surface>>` extension) that refers to an code:ANativeWindow,
Android's native surface type.
The code:ANativeWindow represents the producer endpoint of any buffer queue,
regardless of consumer endpoint.
Common consumer endpoints for code:ANativeWindows are the system window
compositor, video encoders, and application-specific compositors importing
the images through a code:SurfaceTexture.

=== New Object Types

None

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending elink:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ANDROID_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR

=== New Enums

None

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR

=== Issues

1) Does Android need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
physical device (and queue family?) and a specific Android display?

*RESOLVED*: No.
Currently on Android, any physical device is expected to be able to present
to the system compositor, and all queue families must support the necessary
image layout transitions and synchronization operations.
