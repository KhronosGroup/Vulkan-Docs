=== Description

Certain use cases for multiview have a need for specifying a separate
viewport and scissor for each view, without using shader-based viewport
indexing as introduced with `apiext:VK_EXT_shader_viewport_index_layer`.

This extension adds a new way to control ViewportIndex with multiview.
When the <<features-multiview-per-view-viewports,
pname:multiviewPerViewViewports>> feature is enabled and if the last
pre-rasterization shader entry point's interface does not use the
code:ViewportIndex built-in decoration, then each view of a multiview render
pass instance will use a viewport and scissor index equal to the
code:ViewIndex.

=== Issues

1) Is it possible to enable/disable the
<<features-multiview-per-view-viewports, pname:multiviewPerViewViewports>>
feature for individual render pass instances?

*RESOLVED*: No, when the multiviewPerViewViewports feature is enabled during
vkCreateDevice, then all created render pass instances (including dynamic
render passes from `apiext:VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`) and all created
VkPipelines will have the feature enabled.
This approach was chosen because it simplifies application code and there is
no known use case to enable/disable the feature for individual render passes or
pipelines.

2) When this extension is used, is the value of code:ViewportIndex
implicitly written by the last pre-rasterization shader stage and can the
value of code:ViewportIndex be read in the fragment shader?

*RESOLVED*: No, use of the extension does not add an implicit
write to code:ViewportIndex in any shader stage, and additionally, the value
of code:ViewportIndex in the fragment shader is undefined.
