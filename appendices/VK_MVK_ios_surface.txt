The `VK_MVK_ios_surface` extension is an instance extension.
It provides a mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by
the `<<VK_KHR_surface>>` extension) that refers to a code:UIView, the native
surface type of iOS, which is underpinned by a code:CAMetalLayer, to support
rendering to the surface using Apple's Metal framework.
