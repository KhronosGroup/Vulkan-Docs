[[spirvenv]]
= Vulkan Environment for SPIR-V

Shaders for Vulkan are defined by the <<spirv-spec,Khronos SPIR-V
Specification>> as well as the <<spirv-extended,Khronos SPIR-V Extended
Instructions for GLSL>> Specification.
This appendix defines additional SPIR-V requirements applying to Vulkan
shaders.

== Versions and Formats

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
A Vulkan 1.1 implementation must: support the 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
versions of SPIR-V and the 1.0 version of the SPIR-V Extended Instructions
for GLSL.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
ifndef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
A Vulkan 1.0 implementation must: support the 1.0 version of SPIR-V and the
1.0 version of the SPIR-V Extended Instructions for GLSL.
endif::VK_VERSION_1_1[]

A SPIR-V module passed into flink:vkCreateShaderModule is interpreted as a
series of 32-bit words in host endianness, with literal strings packed as
described in section 2.2 of the SPIR-V Specification.
The first few words of the SPIR-V module must: be a magic number and a
SPIR-V version number, as described in section 2.3 of the SPIR-V
Specification.


[[spirvenv-capabilities]]
== Capabilities

The SPIR-V capabilities listed below must: be supported if the corresponding
feature or extension is enabled, or if no features or extensions are listed
for that capability.
Extensions are only listed when there is not also a feature bit associated
with that capability.

[[spirvenv-precision-operation]]
== Precision and Operation of SPIR-V Instructions

The following rules apply to both single and double-precision floating point
instructions:

  * Positive and negative infinities and positive and negative zeros are
    generated as dictated by <<ieee-754,IEEE 754>>, but subject to the
    precisions allowed in the following table.
  * Dividing a non-zero by a zero results in the appropriately signed
    <<ieee-754,IEEE 754>> infinity.
  * Any denormalized value input into a shader or potentially generated by
    any instruction in a shader may: be flushed to 0.
  * The rounding mode cannot: be set, and results will be <<Correctly
    Rounded>>, as described below.
  * [eq]##NaN##s may: not be generated.
    Instructions that operate on a [eq]#NaN# may: not result in a [eq]#NaN#.
  * Support for signaling [eq]##NaN##s is optional: and exceptions are never
    raised.

The precision of double-precision instructions is at least that of single
precision.

The precision of operations is defined either in terms of rounding, as an
error bound in ULP, or as inherited from a formula as follows.

.Correctly Rounded
Operations described as "`correctly rounded`" will return the infinitely
precise result, [eq]#x#, rounded so as to be representable in
floating-point.
The rounding mode used is not defined but if [eq]#x# is exactly
representable then [eq]#x# will be returned.
Otherwise, either the floating-point value closest to and no less than
[eq]#x# or the value closest to and no greater than [eq]#x# will be
returned.

.ULP
Where an error bound of [eq]#n# ULP (units in the last place) is given, for
an operation with infinitely precise result #x# the value returned must be
in the range #[x - n * ulp(x), x + n * ulp(x)]#.
The function #ulp(x)# is defined as follows:

 :: If there exist non-equal floating-point numbers #a# and #b# such that
[eq]#a {leq} x {leq} b# then #ulp(x)# is the minimum possible distance
between such numbers, latexmath:[ulp(x) = \mathrm{min}_{a,b} | b - a |].
If such numbers do not exist then #ulp(x)# is defined to be the difference
between the two finite floating-point numbers nearest to #x#.

Where the range of allowed return values includes any value of magnitude
larger than that of the largest representable finite floating-point number,
operations may return an infinity of the appropriate sign.
If the infinitely precise result of the operation is not mathematically
defined then the value returned is undefined:.

.Inherited From ...
Where an operation's precision is described as being inherited from a
formula, the result returned must be at least as accurate as the result of
computing an approximation to [eq]#x# using a formula equivalent to the
given formula applied to the supplied inputs.
Specifically, the formula given may be transformed using the mathematical
associativity, commutativity and distributivity of the operators involved to
yield an equivalent formula.
The SPIR-V precision rules, when applied to each such formula and the given
input values, define a range of permitted values.
If [eq]#NaN# is one of the permitted values then the operation may return
any result, otherwise let the largest permitted value in any of the ranges
be [eq]#F~max~# and the smallest be [eq]#F~min~#.
The operation must return a value in the range [eq]#[x - E, x + E]# where
latexmath:[E = \mathrm{max} \left( | x - F_{\mathrm{min}} |, | x -
F_{\mathrm{max}} | \right) ].

For single precision (32 bit) instructions, precisions are required: to be
at least as follows, unless decorated with RelaxedPrecision:
