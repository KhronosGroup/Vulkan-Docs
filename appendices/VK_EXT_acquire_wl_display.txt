This extension allows an application to take exclusive control of a display
currently associated with a Wayland compositor.
When control is acquired, the display will be unassociated from the Wayland
compositor until the application releases the display or the specified display
connection is closed.
Essentially, the Wayland compositor will behave as if the monitor has been
unplugged until the application releases it.
