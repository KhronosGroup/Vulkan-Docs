=== Description

This extension adds the slink:VkQueryLowLatencySupportNV structure, a
structure used to query support for NVIDIA Reflex.

include::{generated}/interfaces/VK_NV_low_latency.adoc[]

=== Issues

1) Why does sname:VkQueryLowLatencySupportNV have output parameters in an
input chain?

*RESOLVED*: We are stuck with this for legacy reasons - we are aware this is
bad behavior and this should not be used as a precedent for future
extensions.
