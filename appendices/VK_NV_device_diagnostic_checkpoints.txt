This extension allows applications to insert markers in the command stream
and associate them with custom data.

If a device lost error occurs, the application may: then query the
implementation for the last markers to cross specific implementation-defined
pipeline stages, in order to narrow down which commands were executing at
the time and might have caused the failure.
