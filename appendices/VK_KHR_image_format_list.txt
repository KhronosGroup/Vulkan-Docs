On some implementations, setting the
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT on image creation can cause access
to that image to perform worse than an equivalent image created without
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT because the implementation does not
know what view formats will be paired with the image.

This extension allows an application to provide the list of all formats that
can: be used with an image when it is created.
The implementation may then be able to create a more efficient image that
supports the subset of formats required by the application without having to
support all formats in the format compatibility class of the image format.
