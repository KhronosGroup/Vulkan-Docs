=== Description

This extension adds almost all of the remaining pipeline state as dynamic
state to help applications further reduce the number of monolithic pipelines
they need to create and bind.

=== Issues

1) What about the VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo state
   `sampleShadingEnable` and `minSampleShading`?
  
UNRESOLVED::
  - `sampleShadingEnable` and `minSampleShading` are required when compiling
    the fragment shader, and it is not meaningful to set them dynamically
    since they always need to match the fragment shader state, so this
    hardware state may as well just come from the pipeline with the fragment
    shader.
