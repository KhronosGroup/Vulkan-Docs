When a pipeline is created, its state and shaders are compiled into zero or
more device-specific executables, which are used when executing commands
against that pipeline.
This extension adds a mechanism to query properties and statistics about the
different executables produced by the pipeline compilation process.
This is intended to be used by debugging and performance tools to allow them
to provide more detailed information to the user.
Certain compile-time shader statistics provided through this extension may
be useful to developers for debugging or performance analysis.

=== Issues

1) What should we call the pieces of the pipeline which are produced by the
compilation process and about which you can query properties and statistics?

*RESOLVED*: Call them "executables".
The name "binary" was used in early drafts of the extension but it was
determined that "pipeline binary" could have a fairly broad meaning (such as
a binary serialized form of an entire pipeline) and was too big of a
namespace for the very specific needs of this extension.
