=== Description

This extension enables an application to import QNX Screen
code:_screen_buffer objects created outside of the Vulkan device into
Vulkan memory objects, where they can be bound to images and buffers.

Some code:_screen_buffer images have implementation-defined _external
formats_ that may: not correspond to Vulkan formats. Sampler {YCbCr}
conversion can: be used to sample from these images and convert them to a
known color space.

code:_screen_buffer is strongly typed, so naming the handle type is
redundant. The internal layout and therefore size of a code:_screen_buffer
image may depend on native usage flags that do not have corresponding Vulkan
counterparts.
