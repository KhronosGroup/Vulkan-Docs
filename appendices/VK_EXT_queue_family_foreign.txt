This extension defines a special queue family,
ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT, which can be used to transfer ownership
of resources backed by external memory to foreign, external queues.
This is similar to ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR, defined in
`<<VK_KHR_external_memory>>`.
The key differences between the two are:

  * The queues represented by ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR must share
    the same physical device and the same driver version as the current
    slink:VkInstance.
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT has no such restrictions.
    It can represent devices and drivers from other vendors, and can even
    represent non-Vulkan-capable devices.
  * All resources backed by external memory support
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR.
    Support for ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT is more restrictive.
  * Applications should expect transitions to/from
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT to be more expensive than transitions
    to/from ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR.
