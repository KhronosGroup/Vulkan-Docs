[[versions]]
= Core Revisions (Informative)

New minor versions of the Vulkan API are defined periodically by the Khronos
Vulkan Working Group.
These consist of some amount of additional functionality added to the core
API, potentially including both new functionality and functionality
<<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> from extensions.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
It is possible to build the specification for earlier versions, but to aid
readability of the latest versions, this appendix gives an overview of the
changes as compared to earlier versions.

Vulkan Version 1.3 <<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> a
number of key extensions into the core API:

include::{generated}/meta/promoted_extensions_VK_VERSION_1_3.adoc[]

All differences in behavior between these extensions and the corresponding
Vulkan 1.3 functionality are summarized below.

=== Differences relative to `VK_EXT_4444_formats`

If the `apiext:VK_EXT_4444_formats` extension is not supported, support for
all formats defined by it are optional in Vulkan 1.3.
There are no members in the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features structure
corresponding to the slink:VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT structure.

=== Differences relative to `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state`

All dynamic state enumerants and entry points defined by
`apiext:VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state` are required in Vulkan 1.3.
There are no members in the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features structure
corresponding to the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicStateFeaturesEXT
structure.

=== Differences relative to `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2`

The optional dynamic state enumerants and entry points defined by
`apiext:VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2` for patch control points and logic
op are not promoted in Vulkan 1.3.

supported, support for all formats defined by it are optional in Vulkan 1.3.
The <<features-textureCompressionASTC_HDR,
pname:textureCompressionASTC_HDR>> member of
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features indicates whether a Vulkan 1.3
implementation supports these formats.

=== Differences relative to `VK_EXT_ycbcr_2plane_444_formats`

If the `apiext:VK_EXT_ycbcr_2plane_444_formats` extension is not supported,
support for all formats defined by it are optional in Vulkan 1.3.

corresponding to the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceYcbcr2Plane444FormatsFeaturesEXT
structure.

=== Additional Vulkan 1.3 Feature Support

[[versions-1.3-new-features]]
In addition to the promoted extensions described above, Vulkan 1.3 added
required support for:

  * SPIR-V version 1.6
  ** SPIR-V 1.6 deprecates (but does not remove) the code:WorkgroupSize
     decoration.
  * The <<features-bufferDeviceAddress, pname:bufferDeviceAddress>> feature
    which indicates support for accessing memory in shaders as storage
    buffers via flink:vkGetBufferDeviceAddress.
  * The <<features-vulkanMemoryModel, pname:vulkanMemoryModel>> and
    <<features-vulkanMemoryModelDeviceScope,
    pname:vulkanMemoryModelDeviceScope>> features, which indicate support
    for the corresponding Vulkan Memory Model capabilities.
  * The <<limits-maxInlineUniformTotalSize,
    pname:maxInlineUniformTotalSize>> limit is added to provide the total
    size of all inline uniform block bindings in a pipeline layout.

    operand of code:OpGroupNonUniformBroadcast to be dynamically uniform
    within a subgroup, and the "`Index`" operand of
    code:OpGroupNonUniformQuadBroadcast to be dynamically uniform within a
    derivative group, in shader modules of version 1.5 or higher.
