=== Description

`apiext:VK_EXT_surface_maintenance1` adds a collection of window system
integration features that were intentionally left out or overlooked in the
original `apiext:VK_KHR_surface` extension.

The new features are as follows:

  * Allow querying number of min/max images from a surface for a particular
    presentation mode.
  * Allow querying a surface's scaled presentation capabilities.
  * Allow querying a surface for the set of presentation modes which can be
    easily switched between without requiring swapchain recreation.

=== Promotion to `VK_KHR_surface_maintenance1`

All functionality in this extension is included in
`apiext:VK_KHR_surface_maintenance1`, with the suffix changed to KHR.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the KHR functionality.
