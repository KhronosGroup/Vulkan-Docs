=== Description

The `VK_KHR_relaxed_block_layout` extension allows implementations to
indicate they can support more variation in block code:Offset decorations.
For example, placing a vector of three floats at an offset of
[eq]#16{times}N {plus} 4#.

See <<interfaces-resources-layout,Offset and Stride Assignment>> for
details.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
