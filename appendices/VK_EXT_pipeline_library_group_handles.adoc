=== Description

When using pipeline libraries in ray tracing pipelines, a library might get
linked into different pipelines in an incremental way.
An application can have a strategy where a ray tracing pipeline is comprised
of N pipeline libraries and is later augumented by creating a new pipeline
with N + 1 libraries.
Without this extension, all group handles must be re-queried as the group
handle is tied to the pipeline, not the library.
This is problematic for applications which aim to decouple construction of
record buffers and the linkage of ray tracing pipelines.

To aid in this, this extension enables support for querying group handles
directly from pipeline libraries.
Group handles obtained from a library must: remain bitwise identical in any
sname:VkPipeline that links to the library.

With this feature, the extension also improves compatibility with DXR 1.1
AddToStateObject(), which guarantees that group handles returned remain
bitwise identical between parent and child pipelines.
In addition, querying group handles from COLLECTION objects is also
supported with that API.
