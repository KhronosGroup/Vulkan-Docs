=== Description

This extension allows a specific case of rendering with a
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo::pname:rasteriationSamples count >= 2
(up to 16 is useful) with single-sample color attachment(s) under certain
conditions. This enables more pixels along the edges of primitives to
be shaded, and the shader can use the builtin input SampleMask as a way to
determine how covered they are. A use case for this is anti-aliased path
rendering.

For specified pipelines, rasterization, the builtin Input SampleMask and
centroid interpolation are all based on the rasterizationSamples pattern.
A pixel is a candidate for shading when any rasterizer sample within the pixel
is considered covered.

With the assumption that VK_COVERAGE_REDUCTION_MODE_MERGE_NV behaves identical
to the above for the case of a single color sample, this extension could be
considered a restricted subset of VK_NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples and requires
that no depth/stencil attachment is present and most depth/stencil state to be
disabled.

=== Issues

1) Why does VK_PIPELINE_MULTISAMPLE_STATE_CREATE_RASTER_MULTISAMPLE_BIT_EXT
exits?

*RESOLVED*: Otherwise there would be an ambiguity when
VK_AMD_mixed_attachment_samples is enabled.


1) Why does VK_PIPELINE_MULTISAMPLE_STATE_CREATE_RASTER_MULTISAMPLE_BIT_EXT
exits?

*RESOLVED*: Otherwise there would be an ambiguity when
VK_AMD_mixed_attachment_samples is enabled. Also, since the flag can only
be present under stricter than usual conditions, it may be a small convenience
to implementors by not having to look at both the MSAA create info and
subpass info. Validation language can also be a bit shorter.

2) Could any ambiguities instead be resolved by adding a new
VkCoverageReductionModeNV enum value?

*UNDER_REVIEW*: Probably, but the reason for not doing so are:

 * Querying support via vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2 for a specific case
is simpler than using
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSupportedFramebufferMixedSamplesCombinationsNV would.

 * Extending VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateFlags doesn't add much extra
work since the flag fields already exists in the MSAA create info. It is likely
that no current implementors even check for a
VkPipelineCoverageReductionStateCreateInfoNV since they only seem to support
one of the two existing modes. Implementors supporting
VK_NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples and not VK_AMD_mixed_attachment_samples can
probably ignore the new
VK_PIPELINE_MULTISAMPLE_STATE_CREATE_RASTER_MULTISAMPLE_BIT_EXT flag entirely.

 * The spec doesn't say anything about VK_NV_coverage_reduction_mode by itself
allowing any form of mixed samples. VK_NV_coverage_reduction_mode also says
it requires VK_NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples, which can't be supported by most
vendors without a way to specify what combinations are allowed; the
requirement seems backwards? Maybe this could be amended by changing various
parts of the spec, but the proposed flag and
VkPhysicalDeviceRasterMultisampleFeaturesEXTproposal are convenient and simple
for this extension's specific use case.
