[[versions]]
= Core Revisions (Informative)

New minor versions of the Vulkan API are defined periodically by the Khronos
Vulkan Working Group.
These consist of some amount of additional functionality added to the core
API, potentially including both new functionality and functionality
<<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> from extensions.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
It is possible to build the specification for earlier versions, but to aid
readability of the latest versions, this appendix gives an overview of the
changes as compared to earlier versions.

=== Additional Vulkan 1.2 Feature Support

[[versions-1.2-new-features]]
In addition to the promoted extensions described above, Vulkan 1.2 added
support for:

  * SPIR-V version 1.4.
  * SPIR-V version 1.5.
  * The <<features-samplerMirrorClampToEdge,samplerMirrorClampToEdge>>
    feature which indicates whether the implementation supports the
    ename:VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE sampler address mode.
  * The
    <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-descriptorindexing,code:ShaderNonUniform>>
    capability in SPIR-V version 1.5.
  * The <<features-shaderOutputViewportIndex,shaderOutputViewportIndex>>
    feature which indicates that the
    <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-shader-viewport-index,code:ShaderViewportIndex>>
    capability can be used.
  * The <<features-shaderOutputLayer,shaderOutputLayer>> feature which
    indicates that the
    <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-shader-layer,code:ShaderLayer>> capability
    can be used.
  * The <<features-subgroupBroadcastDynamicId,subgroupBroadcastDynamicId>>
    feature which allows the "`Id`" operand of
    code:OpGroupNonUniformBroadcast to be dynamically uniform within a
    subgroup, and the "`Index`" operand of
    code:OpGroupNonUniformQuadBroadcast to be dynamically uniform within a
    derivative group, in shader modules of version 1.5 or higher.
  * The <<features-drawIndirectCount,drawIndirectCount>> feature which
    indicates whether the flink:vkCmdDrawIndirectCount and
    flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount functions can be used.
  * The <<features-descriptorIndexing,descriptorIndexing>> feature which
    indicates the implementation supports the minimum number of descriptor
    indexing features as defined in the <<features-requirements,Feature
    Requirements>> section.
  * The <<features-samplerFilterMinmax,samplerFilterMinmax>> feature which
    indicates whether the implementation supports the minimum number of
    image formats that support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_MINMAX_BIT feature bit as
    defined by the
    <<limits-filterMinmaxSingleComponentFormats-minimum-requirements,pname:filterMinmaxSingleComponentFormats>>
    property minimum requirements.
  * The
    <<limits-framebufferIntegerColorSampleCounts,framebufferIntegerColorSampleCounts>>
    limit which indicates the color sample counts that are supported for all
    framebuffer color attachments with integer formats.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
[[versions-1.1]]
== Version 1.1

[[versions-1.1-promotions]]
Vulkan Version 1.1 <<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> a
number of key extensions into the core API:

include::{generated}/meta/promoted_extensions_VK_VERSION_1_1.txt[]

The only changes to the functionality added by these extensions were to
`VK_KHR_shader_draw_parameters`, which had the
<<features-shaderDrawParameters, pname:shaderDrawParameters>> feature bit
added to determine support in the core API, and
<<features-variablePointersStorageBuffer,
pname:variablePointersStorageBuffer>> from `VK_KHR_variable_pointers` was
made optional.

[[versions-1.1-new-features]]
Additionally, Vulkan 1.1 added support for <<shaders-group-operations, group
operations>> with <<shaders-scope-subgroup, subgroup scope>>,
<<memory-protected-memory, protected memory>>, and a new command to
<<vkEnumerateInstanceVersion, enumerate the instance version>>.

=== Differences relative to `VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion`

If the `<<VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion>>` extension is not supported,
support for the <<features-samplerYcbcrConversion,samplerYcbcrConversion>>
feature is optional.
Support for this feature is defined by
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features::pname:samplerYcbcrConversion when
queried via flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.
