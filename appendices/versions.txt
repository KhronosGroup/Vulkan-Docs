[[versions]]
= Core Revisions (Informative)

New minor versions of the Vulkan API are defined periodically by the Khronos
Vulkan Working Group.
These consist of some amount of additional functionality added to the core
API, potentially including both new functionality and functionality
<<extendingvulkan-compatibility-promotion,promoted>> from extensions.

ifdef::VK_VERSION_1_1[]
It is possible to build the specification for earlier versions, but to aid
readability of the latest versions, this appendix gives an overview of the
changes as compared to earlier versions.

  * The <<features-samplerMirrorClampToEdge,samplerMirrorClampToEdge>>
    feature which indicates whether the implementation supports the
    ename:VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE sampler address mode.

    <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-ShaderLayer,code:ShaderLayer>> capability
    can be used.
  * The <<features-subgroupBroadcastDynamicId,subgroupBroadcastDynamicId>>
    feature which allows the "`Id`" operand of
    code:OpGroupNonUniformBroadcast to be dynamically uniform within a
    subgroup, and the "`Index`" operand of
    code:OpGroupNonUniformQuadBroadcast to be dynamically uniform within a
    derivative group, in shader modules of version 1.5 or higher.
  * The <<features-drawIndirectCount,drawIndirectCount>> feature which
    indicates whether the flink:vkCmdDrawIndirectCount and
    flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount functions can be used.

    indicates the implementation supports the minimum number of descriptor
    indexing features as defined in the <<features-requirements,Feature
    Requirements>> section.

    indicates whether the implementation supports the minimum number of
    image formats that support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_MINMAX_BIT feature bit as
    defined by the
    <<limits-filterMinmaxSingleComponentFormats-minimum-requirements,pname:filterMinmaxSingleComponentFormats>>
    property minimum requirements.
