=== Description

Renderpass attachments can: be read-only for the duration of a render pass.

Examples include input attachments and depth attachments where depth tests
are enabled but depth writes are not enabled.

In such cases, there can: be no contents generated for an attachment within
the render area.

This extension adds a new elink:VkAttachmentStoreOp
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_QCOM which specifies that the contents
within the render area may: not be written to memory, but that the prior
contents of the attachment in memory are preserved.
However, if any contents were generated within the render area during
rendering, the contents of the attachment will be undefined: inside the
render area.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The elink:VkAttachmentStoreOp ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE may: force
an implementation to assume that the attachment was written and force an
implementation to flush data to memory or to a higher level cache.
The elink:VkAttachmentStoreOp ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_QCOM may:
allow an implementation to assume that the attachment was not written and
allow an implementation to avoid such a flush..
