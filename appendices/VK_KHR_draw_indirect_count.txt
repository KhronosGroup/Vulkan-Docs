=== Description

This extension is based off the `<<VK_AMD_draw_indirect_count>>` extension.
This extension allows an application to source the number of draw calls for
indirect draw calls from a buffer.
This enables applications to generate arbitrary amounts of draw commands and
execute them without host intervention.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.2

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.2, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
However, if Vulkan 1.2 is supported and this extension is not, the entry
points flink:vkCmdDrawIndirectCount and flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount
are optional.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
