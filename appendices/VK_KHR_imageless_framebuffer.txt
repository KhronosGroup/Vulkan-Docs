This extension allows framebuffers to be created without the need for
creating images first, allowing more flexibility in how they are used, and
avoiding the need for many of the confusing compatibility rules.

Framebuffers are now created with a small amount of additional metadata
about the image views that will be used in
slink:VkFramebufferAttachmentsCreateInfoKHR, and the actual image views are
provided at render pass begin time via
slink:VkRenderPassAttachmentBeginInfoKHR.
