=== Description

This extension allows the flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR and
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR functions to accept
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE as their pname:surface parameter, allowing potential
surface formats, colorspaces and present modes to be queried without
providing a surface.
Identically, flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormats2KHR,
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT, and
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR would accept
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE in
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceSurfaceInfo2KHR::pname:surface.
*This can only be supported on platforms where the results of these queries
are surface-agnostic and a single presentation engine is the implicit target
of all present operations*.
