This extension adds support for the following SPIR-V extension in Vulkan:

  * +SPV_KHR_post_depth_coverage+

which allows the fragment shader to control whether values in the
code:SampleMask built-in input variable reflect the coverage after the
<<fragops-early,early per-fragment>> depth and stencil tests are applied.

This extension adds a new code:PostDepthCoverage execution mode under the
code:SampleMaskPostDepthCoverage capability.
When this mode is specified along with code:EarlyFragmentTests, the value of
an input variable decorated with the
<<interfaces-builtin-variables-samplemask, code:SampleMask>> built-in
reflects the coverage after the <<shaders-fragment-earlytest, early fragment
tests>> are applied.
Otherwise, it reflects the coverage before the depth and stencil tests.

When using GLSL source-based shading languages, the code:post_depth_coverage
layout qualifier from GL_ARB_post_depth_coverage or
GL_EXT_post_depth_coverage maps to the code:PostDepthCoverage execution
mode.
