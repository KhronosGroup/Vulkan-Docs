=== Description

This extension provides new facilities to query DRM properties for physical
devices, enabling users to match Vulkan physical devices with DRM nodes on
Linux.

Its functionality closely overlaps with
`EGL_EXT_device_drm`^<<VK_EXT_physical_device_drm-fn1,1>>^.
Unlike the EGL extension, this extension does not expose a string containing
the name of the device file and instead exposes device minor numbers.

DRM defines multiple device node types.
Each physical device may have one primary node and one render node
associated.
Physical devices may have no primary node (e.g. if the device does not have
a display subsystem), may have no render node (e.g. if it is a software
rendering engine), or may have neither (e.g. if it is a software rendering
engine without a display subsystem).

To query DRM properties for a physical device, chain
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceDrmPropertiesEXT to slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.
