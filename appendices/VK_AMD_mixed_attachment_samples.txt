This extension enables applications to use multisampled rendering with a
depth/stencil sample count that is larger than the color sample count.
Having a depth/stencil sample count larger than the color sample count
allows maintaining geometry and coverage information at a higher sample rate
than color information.
All samples are depth/stencil tested, but only the first color sample count
number of samples get a corresponding color output.
