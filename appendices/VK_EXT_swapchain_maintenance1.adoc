=== Description

`apiext:VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1` adds a collection of window system
integration features that were intentionally left out or overlooked in the
original `apiext:VK_KHR_swapchain` extension.

The new features are as follows:

  * Specify a fence that will be signaled when the resources associated with
    a present operation can: be safely destroyed.
  * Allow changing the present mode a swapchain is using at per-present
    granularity.
  * Allow applications to define the behavior when presenting a swapchain
    image to a surface with different dimensions than the image.
    Using this feature may: allow implementations to avoid returning
    ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR in this situation.
  * Allow applications to defer swapchain memory allocation for improved
    startup time and memory footprint.
  * Allow applications to release previously acquired images without
    presenting them.
