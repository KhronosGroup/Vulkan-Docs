This extension allows the fragment coverage value, represented as an integer
bitmask, to be substituted for a color output being written to a
single-component color attachment with integer components (e.g.
ename:VK_FORMAT_R8_UINT).
The functionality provided by this extension is different from simply
writing the code:SampleMask fragment shader output, in that the coverage
value written to the framebuffer is taken after stencil test and depth test,
as well as after fragment operations such as alpha-to-coverage.

This functionality may be useful for deferred rendering algorithms, where
the second pass needs to know which samples belong to which original
fragments.
