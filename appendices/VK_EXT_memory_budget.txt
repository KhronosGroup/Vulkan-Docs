This extension adds support for querying the amount of memory used and the
total memory budget for a memory heap.
The values returned by this query are implementation-dependent and can
depend on a variety of factors including operating system and system load.

The pname:heapBudget values can be used as a guideline for how much total
memory from each heap the process can use at any given time, before
allocations may start failing or causing performance degradation.
The values may change based on other activity in the system that is outside
the scope and control of the Vulkan implementation.
