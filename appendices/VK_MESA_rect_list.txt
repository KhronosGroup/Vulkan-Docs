=== Description

This extension adds a new elink:VkPrimitiveTopology code:enum where rectangles
can be generated from a series of 3 axis-aligned vertices.
This can be useful for drawing a rectangle without being split into two
triangles with an internal edge.
It is also useful to minimize the number of primitives that need to be
drawn, particularly for a user interface.
