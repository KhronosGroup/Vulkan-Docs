=== Short Description

Enables C-like structure layout for SPIR-V blocks.

=== Description

This extension modifies the alignment rules for uniform buffers, storage
buffers and push constants, allowing non-scalar types to be aligned solely
based on the size of their components, without additional requirements.

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending elink:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SCALAR_BLOCK_LAYOUT_FEATURES_EXT

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeaturesEXT

=== Issues

None.

=== Version History

  * Revision 1, 2018-11-14 (Tobias Hector)
