=== Description

This extension allows applications to create single-pass render pass
instances without needing to create render pass objects or framebuffers.
Dynamic render passes can also span across multiple primary command buffers,
rather than relying on secondary command buffers.

This extension also incorporates ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_KHR from
`apiext:VK_QCOM_render_pass_store_ops`, enabling applications to avoid
unnecessary synchronization when an attachment is not written during a
render pass.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.3

Functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.3, with the KHR
suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.
