The files in, and generated output documents from this Vulkan-Docs
project are under a mix of copyright and license statements. Refer to
the individual files for specific information. As a general
guideline:

* The Vulkan Specification asciidoc sources, as well as other documentation
  which we expect people may wish to regenerate and distributed in other
  formats - such as the reference pages generated from the Specification
  source - are under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.
** The specification sources have only recently (as of June 2017) been
   placed under this license. We will now be able to accept pull requests on
   Github, but there is a related Contribution License Agreement which
   people proposing PRs to the Vulkan-Docs repository must execute as part
   of opening the PR.
* Generated output documents, including the official Vulkan Specification
  PDF and HTML documents, are under a proprietary Khronos license. See
  https://www.khronos.org/registry/speccopyright.html . Only Specification
  documents posted in the Vulkan Registry are official.
* The Vulkan headers, spec build tools, and spec and registry configuration
  files are, for the most part, under the Apache 2 license. Some older files
  are under BSD-like licenses which may eventually be updated to Apache 2 as
  we have time.
* There may be some configuration files customized from material shipped
  with the asciidoc and dblatex distributions. Such files continue under
  their original copyrights.
* Some generated, transient files produced during the course of building
  the specification, headers, or other targets may not have copyrights.
  These are typically very short asciidoc fragments describing parts of
  the Vulkan API, and are incorporated by reference into specification
  or reference page builds.
* If something is missing a copyright statement and that poses an
  *actual problem* for whatever you're doing, file an issue on GitHub
  and we'll eventually correct it in some fashion.

Working with the different Khronos member company IP lawyers to make
license changes is a very slow process constrained by the Khronos Member
Agreement and IP Policy as well as by individual company concerns about
their IP. Do not expect rapid changes in anything having to to with
copyrights and licensing.
