<!-- Vulkan KHR Extension Development Checklist Template -->

<!--
This template captures requirements checklists for key milestones
a Vulkan KHR extension passes as it moves from development to
ratification and release. You should create an issue from this template
when there is reasonable consensus in the working group that the
extension should be created.

As progress is made on work items, fill in the italicized fields with
appropriate data. For example, when a merge request exists, edit it
into the "API specification ready" line in place of _MR_.  When the WG
agrees that it ready for a ratification vote, check off the item in
the checklist.
("Ready for ratification" implies that all discussions are
resolved and there are no MRs in flight that modify behavior defined
by the extension or its dependencies.)

Not all requirements are relevant to all extensions. For example, an
extension that has no language dependencies will not need SPIR-V /
GLSL / HLSL items. In such cases, check the item off and write "N/A"
in the associated data fields. Requirements may also be checked off
if waived by vote of the working group, with a 2/3 majority of
non-abstaining vote are in favor.
