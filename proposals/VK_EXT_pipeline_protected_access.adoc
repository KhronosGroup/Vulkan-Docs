This proposal regards pipeline access to protected memory, and provides the
means for applications to distinguish between pipelines that do and do not
access protected memory.

== Problem Statement

Currently, access to protected memory is enabled with the
`VkPhysicalDeviceProtectedMemoryFeatures::protectedMemory` feature.
As this feature is enabled on the device, every pipeline created by the driver
may be used to access protected memory.
For some vendors, this has negative ramifications on the performance of
pipeline creation and/or execution.

Some applications may require access to protected memory in a handful of
pipelines while the rest of the pipelines do not.
In some cases, it may not be known at device creation time whether protected memory access
would be necessary, for example in an OpenGL layer over Vulkan.
Enabling the `protectedMemory` feature in such applications could lead to
reduced performance with every pipeline instead of only those that do in fact
access protected memory.

This proposal addresses this problem by allowing applications to specify
protected memory access in pipeline granularity.

== Solution Space

The proposed solution is a new Vulkan extension that allows the application to
specify whether and how each individual pipeline may access protected memory.

=== Per Pipeline Protected Access Flag

A `VkPipelineCreateFlagBits` flag can be specified to disallow
the pipeline from being used in a protected command buffer and submission.

An additional `VkPipelineCreateFlagBits` flag could restrict the usage
of a pipeline to protected command buffers.

Pros:

- Simple to use

Cons:

- If protected access is required for only one kind of resource, for example a
  protected buffer, the use of a single boolean disallows optimizations that
  could be applicable to access to other kinds of resources.

=== Per Usage Access Flags

An alternative could be to provide the usages that may require protected memory
access when creating a pipeline; a set of `VkBufferUsageFlags` and
`VkImageUsageFlags` flags.

Pros:

- Specifying protected access to one usage does not disallow optimizations to
  accesses to unprotected resources that are used differently.

Cons:

- If many resources with the same usage are accessed, but not all need to be
  protected, access to all of them may be suboptimal.

=== Per Resource Access Flags

Ultimately, the application could specify exactly which resources may be
protected; a flag for each render pass attachment, a flag for each binding in
the descriptor set layout, a flag for each vertex binding, etc.

Pros:

- This can theoretically lead to the most efficient pipeline that only pays a
  potential penalty for access to the exact resources that use protected memory.

Cons:

- This is considerably more complex, requiring flags added to numerous places.

== Proposal

In practice, pipelines that actually access protected memory are scarce and
rarely, if ever, access a mixture of protected and unprotected resources of the
same kind.
Additionally, on some hardware, not all combinations of protected access for
input and output resources are possible.
As such, the first solution is adopted in this extension, serving the needs of
all known users without introducing unnecessary complexity.

=== Features

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineProtectedAccessFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineProtectedAccess;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineProtectedAccessFeaturesEXT;
----

- `pipelineProtectedAccess` specifies that per-pipeline protected access can be
  specified.

When this feature is enabled, pipelines can be flagged as not accessing
protected resources (as otherwise is assumed by the `protectedMemory` feature).
Such pipelines are not allowed to be bound to protected command buffers.
Conversely, they can be flagged such that they can only be bound to protected
command buffers.

=== Pipeline Creation

To create a pipeline that will not access protected memory, and that cannot be
used in a protected command buffer and submission, specify the
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_NO_PROTECTED_ACCESS_BIT_EXT` create flag.

To create a pipeline that may access protected memory, and that cannot be used
in a non-protected command buffer and submission, specify the
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_PROTECTED_ACCESS_ONLY_BIT_EXT` create flag.

== Issues

=== RESOLVED: How should the `pipelineProtectedAccess` feature interact with `protectedMemory`?

The `pipelineProtectedAccess` feature allows pipelines to be restricted to or
excluded from access to protected resources.
Without the `protectedMemory` feature, there cannot be any protected resources
to begin with.
As such, enabling the `pipelineProtectedAccess` feature without the
`protectedMemory` is ineffective, but is nevertheless not incorrect.

=== RESOLVED: Should the `pipelineProtectedAccess` feature allow pipelines to opt into protected access or out of it?

Both, with the default retaining current Vulkan behavior.
This is necessary to make sure that the mere act of enabling the
`pipelineProtectedAccess` feature does not break existing code.
Opt-in is supported in addition to opt-out to help platforms where the specific
knowledge that a pipeline is only used with protected command buffers leads to
possible optimizations.

=== RESOLVED: Should links between protected and unprotected pipeline libraries be allowed?

No.
The linked pipeline could not be considered protected in that case, as parts of
it has been created without the necessary flag.
And if the result is an unprotected pipeline, it is not useful (or efficient)
to create parts of it as protected.
