This extension enables applications to use derivative operations from execution models with defined workgroups.

NOTE: This extension is a promotion (with additions) of
link:{extensions}VK_NV_compute_shader_derivatives[VK_NV_compute_shader_derivatives].
As that extension already shipped before proposal documents existed, this document has been written
retroactively during promotion to KHR.

The changes relative to `VK_NV_compute_shader_derivatives` are the inclusion of optional
mesh and task shader support.


== Problem Statement

As some developers replace portions of the graphics pipeline by custom algorithms in compute, certain operations reserved for fragment shaders such as derivatives become a major hurdle to work around.  This manifests in particular when using Shader Model 6.6 where derivative and derivative-dependent texture sample operations are required to be supported, but have no equivalent in Vulkan other than a vendor specific extension.

== Solution Space

Three options have been considered:

- Take VK_NV_compute_shader_derivatives as-is.
- Take VK_NV_compute_shader_derivatives and add support for all execution models with defined workgroup size.
- Start afresh

This proposal focuses on the second option.

== Proposal

=== New SPIR-V execution modes

This extension adds Vulkan support for the {spirv}/KHR/SPV_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives.html[`SPV_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives`] SPIR-V extension.

The SPIR-V extension provides two new execution modes, both of which allow execution models with defined workgroups to use built-ins that evaluate derivatives explicitly or implicitly. Derivatives will be computed via differencing over a 2x2 group of shader invocations.

 - The 'DerivativeGroupQuadsKHR' execution mode assembles shader invocations into 2x2 groups, where each group has x and y coordinates of the local invocation ID of the form (2m+{0,1}, 2n+{0,1}).
 - The 'DerivativeGroupLinearKHR' execution mode assembles shader invocations into 2x2 groups, where each group has local invocation index values of the form 4m+{0,1,2,3}.

=== Features

A new feature enables each of the SPIR-V execution modes introduced by this extension:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceComputeShaderDerivativesFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType                         sType;
    void*                                   pNext;
    VkBool32                                computeDerivativeGroupQuads;
    VkBool32                                computeDerivativeGroupLinear;
} VkPhysicalDeviceComputeShaderDerivativesFeaturesKHR;
----

Each value maps to a SPIR-V execution mode:
 - computeDerivativeGroupQuads enables the SPIR-V 'DerivativeGroupQuadsKHR' execution mode
 - computeDerivativeGroupLinear enables the SPIR-V 'DerivativeGroupLinearKHR' execution mode

=== Properties

A new property is added which determines if the new execution modes can be used in mesh and task shaders:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceComputeShaderDerivativesPropertiesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           meshAndTaskShaderDerivatives;
} VkPhysicalDeviceComputeShaderDerivativesPropertiesKHR;
----

If this property is 'VK_FALSE', the derivatives are only supported in compute shaders.

=== GLSL mapping

The following layout qualifiers from GLSL_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives map to these SPIR-V execution modes:

 - derivative_group_quadsKHR layout qualifier -> DerivativeGroupQuadsKHR Execution Mode
 - derivative_group_linearKHR layout qualifier -> DerivativeGroupLinearKHR Execution Mode

== Issues

(1) Should we specify that the groups of four shader invocations used for
    derivatives in a compute shader are the same groups of four invocations
    that form a "quad" in shader subgroups?

*RESOLVED*: Yes.

(2) Should we add support for derivatives in mesh and task shaders?

*RESOLVED*: Yes, as optional features. Add them as an optional feature as they are in SM6.6.
