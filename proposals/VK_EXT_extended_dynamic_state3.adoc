This document details the motivation behind another extended dynamic state extension, which follows VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state and VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2.

== Problem Statement

Since the release of VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state and VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2 in Vulkan 1.3, which made
more pipeline state dynamic, there is still some remaining pipeline state that cannot be changed dynamically.
Dynamic state helps applications reduce the number of pipelines they need to create and bind.
It was also noted that several extensions that add pipeline state lack dynamic state equivalents.

Reducing the amount of state required to build a pipeline can also help applications build pipelines ahead of time
and avoid hitching since that state might not be known until right before the draw command is recorded. By making it
dynamic there is less state that applications need to hash and cache for on-demand pipeline creation.

These additional dynamic states can also help pare down the pipeline state to help other extensions build on this
and potentially remove the need to create and bind linked monolithic pipeline objects at all.


== Solution Space

This proposal adds more dynamic state that hardware vendors can optionally implement, with enough in common
between most vendors to be useful for applications.
This extension also sets a baseline for a potential roadmap for future hardware to handle all dynamic state efficiently.

Some of the dynamic state added by this proposal may not have immediate benefits for applications
since the state could be constant throughout the application, but it is added anyway to
capture as much pipeline state as possible and lay a foundation for potentially doing away with linked
monolithic pipeline objects.

Adding more and more dynamic state by itself is not the solution to all pipeline problems, and this extension
does not attempt go beyond adding dynamic state to address those other problems.


== Proposal

IHVs should only implement support for the dynamic state below if it is efficient on their
platform. Feature bits are provided for all state so IHVs can implement any subset of
VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3.
