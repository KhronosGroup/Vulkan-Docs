This document proposes extending support for cooperative matrices to make them
more broadly useful.

== Problem Statement

While VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix can be used to accelerate "simple" GEMMs, it
has some serious limitations:

 * Subgroup scope matrices are small enough that using them the natural way
   in a GEMM does not lead to good performance. Shader authors can work around
   this by explicitly tiling and staging through shared memory, but it is
   cumbersome. Similarly, for networks that need slightly larger matrices that
   should still fit in the register file, they are again required to explicitly
   tile.
 * Some networks require operations like reductions or matrix _Use_ conversions,
   and currently these require a round trip through shared memory.
 * Simple row/col-major ordering is fine for 2D tensors, but many networks
   have tensors with more dimensions, more complex slicing of tensors, and
   padding at tensor boundaries. VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix does not address
   these use cases.
 * Many large networks store weights in a quantized format, and there is not
   a great way to dequantize these as they are loaded into a cooperative
   matrix.

Fortunately, VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix provides a solid foundation that we can
extend to address all of these issues.

We hope that this new functionality is useful both for handwritten shaders and
as a target for graph compilers.

== Solution Space

This proposal includes several new features, each with their own solution
spaces:

 * Compilers can easily scale matrix sizes by internally tiling them, and more
   flexible matrix dimensions are clearly valuable for ease of use. The main
   question is whether the sizes should be completely arbitrary, or defined as
   a multiple of some minimum granularity. Completely arbitrary sizes might
   lead to unexpected complexity or performance issues, so for simplicity this
   extension adds minimum granularities, and any multiple is supported up to
   some relatively large upper bound. Additionally, supporting matrices at
   workgroup scope allows implementations to more efficiently support larger
   matrix sizes, and to optimize their loads by automatically staging them
   through shared memory.
 * Matrix _Use_ conversions are important for writing fused network kernels,
   so that an accumulator can be used as an operand for another multiply.
   The most important conversions seem to be Accumulator->A, and
   Accumulator->B with optional transpose. To minimize complexity, this is
   all that is supported for now.
 * Reductions are common in networks, for example softmax activation requires
   a reduction over rows, and max-pooling requires a reduction over 2x2
   neighborhoods. We support these in Accumulator matrices since that is the
   primary place they are needed. It is also possible to do sum-reduce of a
   row of an A matrix or a column of a B matrix by multiplying by a matrix
   of all ones, so we do not add an additional way to do this.
 * The existing row/col-major pitch-based addressing only covers the simplest
   use cases and misses a lot of real-world use cases, like slicing and
   reinterpreting views of tensors, and clamping/padding at tensor boundaries.
   We considered fully programmable addressing (e.g. function pointer to
   calculate addresses), but the generality makes it difficult for the
   implementation to do optimizations like coalescing loads or staging through
   shared memory. The solution we settled on, tensor layouts and views, are
   conceptually similar to how tensors are handled in APIs like PyTorch, so
   it handles common use cases. The regular structure imposed by the tensor
   layout aids the compiler in performing the aforementioned optimizations.
   And while the tensor layout and view calculations appear expensive in their
   full generality, applications "pay for what they use" and the simpler cases
   are still pretty cheap.
 * Quantized weights are often stored in sub-byte types (e.g. int4) or as part
   of a larger block, and need to be scaled and/or run through a lookup table
   to produce the dequantized value. Previously, this had to be done manually
   and copied into shared memory to be loaded into a matrix. We support block
   dimensions in the addressing calculations and a decode callback function that
   allows the values to be dequantized as they are loaded into the matrix.

== Proposal

The solution space section describes all the separate features of the proposal
and which solutions we have chosen. Then a final question is how to package these
features. Most of these can be used independently as incremental additions to
VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix. These are specified as independent feature enables
(and independent SPIR-V capabilities) so implementations can adopt them
incrementally (or they could be promoted incrementally) if needed. There are no
specific required features.

== Examples

A workgroup scope GEMM:

[source,c]
----
    uvec2 tileID = uvec2(gl_WorkGroupID.xy);

    // Initialize result to zero
    result = coopmat<C_TYPE, gl_ScopeWorkgroup, TILE_M, TILE_N, gl_MatrixUseAccumulator>(0.0);

    // Create tensor layouts for A, B, Accumulator
    tensorLayoutNV<2> tensorLayoutA = createTensorLayoutNV(2);
    tensorLayoutNV<2> tensorLayoutB = createTensorLayoutNV(2);
    tensorLayoutNV<2> tensorLayoutC = createTensorLayoutNV(2);

    tensorLayoutA = setTensorLayoutDimensionNV(tensorLayoutA, M, K);
    tensorLayoutB = setTensorLayoutDimensionNV(tensorLayoutB, K, N);
    tensorLayoutC = setTensorLayoutDimensionNV(tensorLayoutC, M, N);

    // Loop over K dimension and accumulate partial results
    for (uint chunkK = 0; chunkK < K; chunkK += TILE_K) {

        coopmat<A_TYPE, gl_ScopeWorkgroup, TILE_M, TILE_K, gl_MatrixUseA> matrixA;
        coopMatLoadTensorNV(matrixA, inputA.x, 0, sliceTensorLayoutNV(tensorLayoutA, TILE_M * tileID.y, TILE_M, chunkK, TILE_K));

        coopmat<A_TYPE, gl_ScopeWorkgroup, TILE_K, TILE_N, gl_MatrixUseB> matrixB;
        coopMatLoadTensorNV(matrixB, inputB.x, 0, sliceTensorLayoutNV(tensorLayoutB, chunkK, TILE_K, TILE_N * tileID.x, TILE_N));

        result = coopMatMulAdd(matrixA, matrixB, result);
    }

    // Load C and compute alpha*(A*B)+beta*C
    coopmat<C_TYPE, gl_ScopeWorkgroup, TILE_M, TILE_N, gl_MatrixUseAccumulator> matrixC;
    coopMatLoadTensorNV(matrixC, inputC.x, 0, sliceTensorLayoutNV(tensorLayoutC, TILE_M * tileID.y, TILE_M, TILE_N * tileID.x, TILE_N));
    result = C_TYPE(alpha) * result + C_TYPE(beta) * matrixC;

    // Store result to memory
    coopMatStoreTensorNV(result, outputD.x, 0, sliceTensorLayoutNV(tensorLayoutC, TILE_M * tileID.y, TILE_M, TILE_N * tileID.x, TILE_N));
----

A reduction computing max over each row of a matrix:

[source,c]
----
    float16_t maxReduce(const in float16_t x, const in float16_t y) {
        return max(x, y);
    }

    mat = ...;

    coopmat<float16_t, gl_ScopeWorkgroup, TILE_M, TILE_N, gl_MatrixUseAccumulator> rowMax;
    coopMatReduceNV(rowMax, mat, gl_CooperativeMatrixReduceRowNV, maxReduce);
----
