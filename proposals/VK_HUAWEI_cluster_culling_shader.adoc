== Problem Statement

When drawing a scene with a massive amount of geometry, it is necessary to remove the invisible geometry to decrease redundant drawing, a common approach used to remove invisible geometry is called cluster culling, a cluster is a subset of a mesh that has as many shared vertices as possible, alternatively, a cluster can also be an entire mesh, cluster will be pre-computed and stored with the geometry to avoid computation at runtime.

The GPU has numerous of thread and parallel computing capabilities, so it is more suitable for culling many clusters than the CPU. Many developers use compute shader for GPU culling tasks. Because compute shader can not generate output which directly connected to the existing rendering pipeline. It is necessary to separate culling and rendering into two passes. First, the culling pass processes the whole scene and updates the MDI command, and then uses the MDI method to draw during the rendering pass.

== Solution space
Provide a new extension to connect the output of the compute shader to the existing rednering pipeline, developers who originally used compute shader for culling can easily migrate to this new extension and have better performance.



== Proposal.
=== Cluster culling shader
This extension allowing application to use a new programmable shader type -- Cluster Culling Shader -- to execute geometry culling on GPU. This mechanism does not require pipeline barrier between compute shader and other rendering pipeline.

This new shader type have execution environments similar to that of compute shaders, where a collection of shader invocations form a workgroup and cooperate to perform coarse level culling and level-of-detail selection, shader invocation can emit a set of built-in output variables to the subsequent rendering pipeline via a new built-in function, these emitted variables form a drawing command used to draw geometries of cluster. 

=== API changes
==== shader stage and synchronization
Extending `VkShaderStageFlagBits:`::
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLUSTER_CULLING_BIT_HUAWEI`
specifies the cluster shader stage.

Extending `VkPipelineStageFlagBits2:`::
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE2_CLUSTER_CULLING_SHADER_BIT_HUAWEI`
 specifies the cluster pipeline stage for synchronization.

==== New structure
Extending `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2`, `VkDeviceCreateInfo:`::
VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI

Extending `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2:`::
`VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderPropertiesHUAWEI`

==== drawcall
dispatching command are recording into a command buffer and when executed by a queue, it will produce work which executes according to the bound Cluster Culling Shader pipeline.

To Record a Cluster Culling Shader command:
```c
void vkCmdDrawClusterHUAWEI(
    VkCommandBuffer 	commandBuffer,
    uint32_t			groupCountX,
    uint32_t			groupCountY,
    uint32_t			groupCountZ );
```
* `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.
* `groupCountX` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the X dimension.
* `groupCountY` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Y dimension
* `groupCountZ` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Z dimension
When the command is executed, a global workgroup consisting of 	`groupCountX`  * `groupCountY` * `groupCountZ` local workgroup is assembled.


To record an indirect Cluster Culling Shader command:
```c
void vkCmdDrawClusterIndirectHUAWEI(
    VkCommandBuffer 	commandBuffer,
    vkBuffer			buffer,
    vkDeviceSize		offset );
```

* `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.
* `buffer` is the buffer containing dispatch parameters.
* `offset` is the byte offset into buffer where parameters begin.

`vkCmdDrawClusterIndirectHUAWEI` behaves similarly to `vkCmdDrawClusterHUAWEI` except that the parameters are read by the device from a buffer during execution. 

==== feature
`VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI` - Structure describing cluster culling shading features that can be supported by an implementation.

`VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI` structure is defined as:
```c
Typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI {
    VkStructureType		sType;
    void*				pNext;
    VkBool32			clustercullingShader;
    VkBool32			multiviewClusterCullingShader;
}VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI;
```

* `sType` is the type of this structure.
* `pNext` is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
* `clustercullingShader` indicates whether the cluster culling stage is supported.
* `multiviewClusterCullingShader` indicates whether multiview can be used with cluster culling shader.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the `VkPhysicalDeviceFeature2` structure passed to `vkPhysicalDeviceFeature2`, it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported.
`VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI` can also be used in the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo` to selectively enable these features. 


==== property
`VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderPropertiesHUAWEI` - Structure describing cluster culling shading properties.
```c
Typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderPropertiesHUAWEI {
    VkStructureType		sType;
    void*				pNext;
    uint32_t			maxWorkGroupCount[3];
    uint32_t		    maxWorkGroupSize[3];
    uint32_t			maxOutputClusterCount;
}VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderFeaturesHUAWEI;
```

* `sType` is the type of this structure.

* `pNext` is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
* `maxWorkgroupCount` is the maximum number of local workgroups that can be launched by a single command. These three value represent the maximum local workgroup count in the X, Y and Z dimensions, respectively. In the current implementation, the values of Y and Z are both implicitly set as one. `groupCountX` of `DrawCluster*` command must be less than or equal to `maxWorkGroupCount[0]`.
* `maxWorkGroupSize` is the maximum size of a local workgroup. These three value represent the maximum local workgroup size in the X, Y and Z dimensions, respectively. The x, y and z sizes, as specified by the LocalSize or LocalSizeId execution mode or by the object decorated by the WorkgroupSize decoration in shader modules, must be less than or equal to the corresponding limit.
* `maxOutputClusterCount` is the maximum number of output clusters that a single workgroup may emit.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceClusterCullingShaderPropertiesHUAWEI` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2` structure passed to `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`, it is filled in with each corresponding implementation-dependent property.

=== SPIR-V changes
==== new capability

`ClusterCullingShadingHUAWEI`

==== execution model
`ClusterCullingHUAWEI`

==== built-in

cluster culling shader have the following built-in output variables, these variables form a aforementioned drawing command.

* `IndexCountHUAWEI` is the number of vertices to draw.

* `VertexCountHUAWEI` is the number of vertices to draw.
* `InstanceCountHUAWEI` is the number of instances to draw.
* `FirstIndexHUAWEI` is the base index within the index buffer.
* `FirstVertexHUAWEI` is the index of the first vertex to draw.
* `VertexOffsetHUAWEI` is the value added to the vertex index before indexing into the vertex buffer.
* `FirstInstanceHUAWEI`Â is the instance ID of the first instance to draw.
* `ClusterIdHUAWEI` is the index of cluster being rendered by this drawing command. Cluster Culling Shader passes this id to vertex shader for cluster related information fetching. When cluster culling shader enable, gl_DrawID will be replaced by gl_ClusterIDHUAWEI in Vertex Shader.

==== new function.
* `OpDispatchClusterHUAWEI`

Any invocation in Cluster Culling Shader can execute this instruction more than once, after execution, it will emite the Cluster Culling Shader built-in output variables which describe in 3.3.3 to the subsequent rendering pipeline. While a workgroup is done, GPU creates warps for VS according to these output variables, all invocations in VertexShader are responsible for shading the vertices.

=== GLSL changes
New write-only output blocks are defined for built-in output variables:
```c
Type 1 (non-indexed mode):
out gl_PerClusterHUAWEI
{
    uint gl_VertexCountHUAWEI;
    uint gl_InstanceCountHUAWEI;
    uint gl_FirstVertexHUAWEI;
    uint gl_FirstInstanceHUAWEI;
    uint gl_ClusterIdHUAWEI;
}
```

```c
Type 2 (indexed mode):
 out gl_PerClusterHUAWEI
{
    uint gl_IndexCountHUAWEI;
    uint gl_InstanceCountHUAWEI;
    uint gl_FirstIndexHUAWEI ;
    int  gl_VertexOffsetHUAWEI;
    uint gl_FirstInstanceHUAWEI;
    uint gl_ClusterIdHUAWEI;
}
```


A new function is added:
```c
void dispatchClusterHUAWEI(void); 
```
