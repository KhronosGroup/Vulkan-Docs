== Problem Statement

The Vulkan render pass mechanism allows the implementation to merge subpasses at render pass
creation time to improve performance or reduce memory bandwidth usage. However, the criteria
for merging are implementation-specific and not visible to applications, and the application
has no way to know which (if any) subpasses were merged.

For performance debugging, applications may want to query whether certain subpasses were
merged, or why they were not. They may also want to disable subpass merging completely or
for certain subpasses, in order to determine the impact of subpass merging on performance.

This proposal attempts to provide feedback and control for the subpass merging. It can be used
for performance debugging or for runtime usage.

== Solution Space

Some new structures can be chained to pNext of VkRenderPassCreateInfo2, then the driver could
provide subpass merging feedback and control subpass merging at render pass creation time.

If the subpasses cannot be merged, the reason could be returned. The driver could change the
conditions of subpass merging based on performance result, or being compatible with future new
extensions, so using a string to store the reason is more flexible than a enumeration.

== Proposal

The following feature is exposed by the VK_EXT_subpass_merge_feedback extension:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceSubpassMergeFeedbackFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType                sType;
    void*                          pNext;
    VkBool32                       subpassMergeFeedback;
}
----

`subpassMergeFeedback` is the main feature enabling this extension's functionality and must
be supported if this extension is supported.

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkRenderPassCreationControlEXT {
    VkStructureType                sType;
    const void*                    pNext;
    VkBool32                       disallowMerging;
}
----

The structure can control the subpass merging for both render pass level and subpass level.
It can be chained to the pNext of VkRenderPassCreateInfo2 or VkSubpassDescription2.

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkRenderPassCreationFeedbackCreateInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType                             sType;
    const void*                                 pNext;
    VkRenderPassCreationFeedbackInfoEXT*        pRenderPassFeedback;
}
----

The structure can get the feedback from render pass level at render pass creation time.
It can be chained to the pNext of VkRenderPassCreateInfo2. The feedback information could
tell application which subpasses are merged.

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkRenderPassCreationFeedbackInfoEXT {
    uint32_t                       postMergeSubpassCount;
}
----

The structure contains the feedback data from render pass level.

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkRenderPassSubpassFeedbackCreateInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType                      sType;
    const void*                          pNext;
    VkRenderPassSubpassFeedbackInfoEXT*  pSubpassFeedback;
----

The structure can get the feedback from subpass level at render pass creation time.
It can be chained to the pNext of VkSubpassDescription2. The feedback information could
tell application whether a subpass is merged into previous subpass and what is the reason
if the subpass cannot be merged.

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkRenderPassSubpassFeedbackInfoEXT {
    VkMergeStatusEXT               mergeStatus;
    char                           description[VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
    uint32_t                       postMergeIndex;
}
----

The structure contains the feedback data from the subpass level.

== Issues

=== RESOLVED: Could the reasons of not merging be enum instead of string?

New enums are introduced in addition to the string.
The enums will cover the main reasons and the string will specify the unspecified reason
of enum.
