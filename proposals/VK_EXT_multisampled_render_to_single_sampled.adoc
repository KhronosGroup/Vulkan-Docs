This document identifies difficulties with efficient multisampled rendering on
tiling GPUs and proposes an extension to improve it.

## Problem Statement

With careful usage of resolve attachments, multisampled image memory allocated
with `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT`, `loadOp` not equal to
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD`, and `storeOp` not equal to
`VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE`, a Vulkan application is able to efficiently
perform multisampled rendering without incurring any additional memory penalty
on tiling GPUs in most cases.

On some tiling GPUs, subpass resolve operations for some formats cannot be done
on the tile, and so additional performance and memory cost is silently paid
similarly to performing the resolve through
link:{refpage}vkCmdResolveImage.html[`vkCmdResolveImage`] after the subpass,
with no feedback to the application.

Additionally, under certain circumstances, the application may not be able to
complete its multisampled rendering within a single render pass; for example if
it does partial rasterization from frame to frame, blending on an image from a
previous frame, or in emulation of `GL_EXT_multisampled_render_to_texture`.
In such cases, the application can use an initial subpass to effectively load
single sampled data from the next subpass's resolve attachment and fill in the
multisampled attachment which otherwise uses `loadOp` equal to
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE`.
However, this is not always possible (for example for stencil in the absence of
`VK_EXT_shader_stencil_export`) and has multiple drawbacks.

Some implementations are able to perform said operation efficiently in
hardware, effectively loading a multisampled attachment from the contents of a
single sampled one.
Together with the ability to perform a resolve operation at the end of a
subpass, these implementations are able to perform multisampled rendering on
single-sampled attachments with no extra memory or bandwidth overhead.

This document proposes an extension that exposes this capability by allowing a
framebuffer and render pass to include single-sampled attachments while
rendering is done with a specified number of samples.

## Proposal

The extension first allows a framebuffer to contain a mixture of single-sampled
and multisampled attachments.
In the absence of `VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT`, a render pass
subpass which performs multisampled rendering with `N` samples would still
require all the attachments used in the subpass to have `N` samples.
Similarly with `VK_EXT_dynamic_rendering`, the attachments can be a mixture of
single-sampled and multisampled if `VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT`
is present.

In the following, a _pass_ refers to either a render pass subpass, or a
`VK_EXT_dynamic_rendering` render pass.

When `VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT` is provided, specifying that
rendering is done with `N` samples, then any attachment used in the pass may
either have one or `N` samples.
In that case, attachments with one sample will automatically load as
multisampled for the duration of the pass (where every pixel's value is
replicated in all samples of that pixel on tile memory) and will automatically
resolve at the end of the pass.
This document refers to such single-sampled attachments as
multisampled-render-to-single-sampled attachments.

Additionally, this extension provides a means to the application to determine
whether usage of a format for attachments will be detrimental to performance
during a pass resolve operation, which can particularly adversely affect
multisampled-render-to-single-sampled passes.

Introduced by this API are:

Feature, advertising whether the implementation supports
multisampled-rendering-to-single-sampled:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           multisampledRenderToSingleSampled;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT;
----

Performance query specifying whether usage of an attachment that is resolved at
the end of a pass with a format will be optimal on hardware:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkSubpassResolvePerformanceQueryEXT {
    VkStructureType               sType;
    void*                         pNext;
    VkBool32                      optimal;
} VkSubpassResolvePerformanceQueryEXT;
----

Specifying that a pass should perform multisampled-rendering-to-single-sampled
with `N` sample counts (extending `VkSubpassDescription2` and
		`VkRenderingInfo`):

[source,c]
----
typedef struct VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType               sType;
    void*                         pNext;
    VkBool32                      multisampledRenderToSingleSampledEnable;
    VkSampleCountFlagBits         rasterizationSamples;
} VkMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledInfoEXT;
----

An image creation flag to indicate the intention of using a single-sampled
image in a multisampled-render-to-single-sampled pass:

[source,c]
----
VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MULTISAMPLED_RENDER_TO_SINGLE_SAMPLED_BIT_EXT
----

In a multisampled-render-to-single-sampled pass with `N` samples, all rendering
is done with `N` samples as if any single-sampled attachments truly had `N`
samples.
This means that
link:{refpage}VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo.html[`VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo::rasterizationSamples`]
would have to be `N`, and rasterization is done identically to Vulkan's
multisampling rules for passes not using this extension.
As such, the functionality in this extension purely affects the load and store
of single-sampled attachments and their automatic representation as
multisampled for the duration of the pass.

Regardless of which load and store ops are used, the single-sampled attachments
in a multisampled-render-to-single-sampled passes are represented as
multisampled.
The different load and store ops behave identically to the case where
multisampled attachments are used.
The following clarifies the ops in combination with
multisampled-render-to-single-sampled attachments:

- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD`: For each pixel, its value is replicated in all
  the `N` corresponding samples at the start of the pass.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR`: The multisampled representation of the
  attachment is cleared, not the single-sampled attachment.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE`: Specifies that the previous contents of
  the single-sampled attachment need not be preserved, and the contents of the
  multisampled representation of the attachment will be undefined.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_EXT`: Specifies that the previous contents of the
  single-sampled attachment will be preserved, but the contents of the
  multisampled representation of the attachment will be undefined.

- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE`: The result of rendering is automatically
  resolved into the single-sampled attachment at the end of the pass and
  multisampled data is discarded.
  With render passes, if a subpass follows that reads from the attachment as a
  multisampled-render-to-single-sampled input attachment, it is undefined
  whether the previous subpass's multisampled data are returned or the resolved
  values.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE`: Specifies that the multisampled contents
  are not needed after rendering, and may be discarded.
  The contents of the single-sampled attachment will be undefined.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_KHR`: Specifies that the contents of the
  single-sampled attachment is not accessed by the store operation, but will be
  undefined if the attachment was written to during the pass.

While this extension adds a query for the resolve performance of attachments
with a format, the results are not limited to
multisampled-render-to-single-sampled passes, and are also applicable to passes
with separate multisampled and single-sampled attachments with a resolve
operation.

== Issues

=== RESOLVED: What about `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`?

Render passes remain the optimal solution for tiling GPUs.
The current limitations of the `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` extension on tiling
GPUs may improve over time, so this extension may be used with dynamic
rendering.

=== RESOLVED: Lack of on-tile-resolve support for some formats will particularly have a negative impact on this extension.  Can there be a format feature flag added?

A specific struct is added to query performance of subpass resolve for each
format.
A format feature flag is avoided for two reasons; one is their scarcity, and
the other is that normally format feature flags imply that the corresponding
functionalities are not allowed if the flag is missing.
In this case however, the implementation necessarily supports subpass resolves
albeit inefficiently, so the lack of such a hypothetical format feature flag
would not block their usage.
