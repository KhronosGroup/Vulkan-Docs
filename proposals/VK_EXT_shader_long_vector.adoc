This extension adds support for vectors with more than four components, and for
vectors whose component count comes from a specialization constant.

== Problem Statement

This is a generalization of the vector support in VK_NV_cooperative_vector. The
goal is to allow long vectors to be used almost anywhere a vector is allowed.

== Solution Space

The design is straightforward. Allow larger component count for OpTypeVector.
Add a new instruction OpTypeVectorIdEXT where the component count comes from
a constant instruction. The main question is whether OpTypeVectorIdEXT and
OpTypeCooperativeVectorNV are the same instruction (they are).

== Proposal

== Examples

None.
