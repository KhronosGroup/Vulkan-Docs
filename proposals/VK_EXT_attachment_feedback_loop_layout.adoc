This document details API design ideas for the `VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout` extension,
which provides functionality to both render to and sample/fetch from the same subresource of an image in a given
render pass.

== Problem Statement

Some applications and API layering efforts need a way to sample from an image that is being rendered to
at the same time. This can either be a color attachment or a depth/stencil attachment.

Some applications and API layering efforts were using
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` for feedback loops against the specification.

The cases that need to be covered are:

  * One-to-one texel-to-pixel interactions.
  * Reading/sampling from a region not currently being written
    to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment.

Ideally, the solution would also support sampling an image using regular texture operations.

== Solution Space

  . Extend input attachments + `subpassLoad` to support disjoint regions: 

 * Using input attachments would also require extra work to patch shaders and re-compile pipelines
   at draw time, which would result in stutter.
 * Would not support using samplers, which is needed by the layers.
 * Would somehow need to support lod-bias/grad which really does not make sense for `subpassLoad`.

  . Require image copies for feedback loops used in this manner

 * There can be hundreds of draws with a feedback loop which results in a hundreds of copies and barriers
   between each draw call, which does not work for performance.

  . Add a new `VkImageLayout` that supports attachment feedback loops.

== Proposal

Add a new layout, `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT`, that supports attachment feedback loops.

It will support all of the following cases:

  * One-to-one texel-to-pixel interactions.
  * Reading/sampling from a region not currently being written
    to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment.
  * Sampling or fetching from the image while it is not a
    color or depth/stencil attachment in the current render pass.
  * Writing to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment while it is not
    being sampled or fetched in the current render pass.

== Issues

=== RESOLVED: Is it possible to use `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT` image layout with sparse images?

Yes, there is no difference between sparse and non-sparse images.
