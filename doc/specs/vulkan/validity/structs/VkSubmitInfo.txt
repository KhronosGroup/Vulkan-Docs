* pname:sType must: be ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO
* pname:pNext must: be `NULL`
* If pname:waitSemaphoreCount is not `0`, pname:pWaitSemaphores must: be a pointer to an array of pname:waitSemaphoreCount valid sname:VkSemaphore handles
* If pname:waitSemaphoreCount is not `0`, pname:pWaitDstStageMask must: be a pointer to an array of pname:waitSemaphoreCount valid combinations of elink:VkPipelineStageFlagBits values
* Each element of pname:pWaitDstStageMask mustnot: be `0`
* If pname:commandBufferCount is not `0`, pname:pCommandBuffers must: be a pointer to an array of pname:commandBufferCount valid sname:VkCommandBuffer handles
* If pname:signalSemaphoreCount is not `0`, pname:pSignalSemaphores must: be a pointer to an array of pname:signalSemaphoreCount valid sname:VkSemaphore handles
* Each of the elements of pname:pWaitSemaphores, the elements of pname:pCommandBuffers and the elements of pname:pSignalSemaphores that are valid handles must: have been created, allocated or retrieved from the same sname:VkDevice
* Any given element of pname:pSignalSemaphores must: currently be unsignalled
* Any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers must: either have been recorded with the VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT, or not currently be executing on the device
* Any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers must: be in the executable state
* If any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers contains commands that execute secondary command buffers, those secondary command buffers must: have been recorded with the ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT, or not currently be executing on the device
* If any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers was created with ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT, it mustnot: have been previously submitted without re-recording that command buffer
* Any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers mustnot: contain commands that execute a secondary command buffer, if that secondary command buffer has been recorded in another primary command buffer after it was recorded into this sname:VkCommandBuffer
* Any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers must: have been created on a sname:VkCommandPool that was created for the same queue family that the calling command's pname:queue belongs to
* Any given element of pname:pCommandBuffers mustnot: have been created with ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_LEVEL_SECONDARY
* Any given element of sname:VkSemaphore in pname:pWaitSemaphores must: refer to a prior signal of that sname:VkSemaphore that won't be consumed by any other wait on that semaphore
* If the <<features-features-geometryShader,geometry shaders>> feature is not enabled, any given element of pname:pWaitDstStageMask mustnot: contain pname:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_GEOMETRY_SHADER_BIT
* If the <<features-features-tessellationShader,tessellation shaders>> feature is not enabled, any given element of pname:pWaitDstStageMask mustnot: contain pname:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_BIT or pname:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_BIT
