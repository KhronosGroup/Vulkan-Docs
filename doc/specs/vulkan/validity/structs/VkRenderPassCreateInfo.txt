* If the pname:attachment member of any element of pname:pInputAttachments, pname:pColorAttachments, pname:pResolveAttachments or pname:pDepthStencilAttachment, or the attachment indexed by any element of pname:pPreserveAttachments in any given element of pname:pSubpasses is bound to a range of a sname:VkDeviceMemory object that overlaps with any other attachment in any subpass (including the same subpass), the sname:VkAttachmentDescription structures describing them must: include ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT in pname:flags
* If the pname:attachment member of any element of pname:pInputAttachments, pname:pColorAttachments, pname:pResolveAttachments or pname:pDepthStencilAttachment, or the value of any element of pname:pPreserveAttachments in any given element of pname:pSubpasses is not ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED, it must: be less than the value of pname:attachmentCount
