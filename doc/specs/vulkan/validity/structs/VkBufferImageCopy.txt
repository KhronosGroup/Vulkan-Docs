Valid Usage
-----------
endif::doctype-manpage[]
* pname:imageSubresource must: be a valid sname:VkImageSubresourceLayers structure
* pname:bufferOffset must: be a multiple of the calling command's sname:VkImage parameter's texel size
* pname:bufferOffset must: be a multiple of `4`
* pname:bufferRowLength must: be `0`, or greater than or equal to the pname:width member of pname:imageExtent
* pname:bufferImageHeight must: be `0`, or greater than or equal to the pname:height member of pname:imageExtent
* pname:imageOffset.x and (pname:imageExtent.width + pname:imageOffset.x) must: both be greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to the image subresource width
* pname:imageOffset.y and (imageExtent.height + pname:imageOffset.y) must: both be greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to the image subresource height
* pname:imageOffset.z and (imageExtent.depth + pname:imageOffset.z) must: both be greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to the image subresource depth
* If the calling command's sname:VkImage parameter is a compressed format image:
*   pname:bufferRowLength, pname:bufferImageHeight and all members of pname:imageOffset must: be a multiple of the block size in the relevant dimensions
*   pname:bufferOffset must: be a multiple of the block size in bytes
*   pname:imageExtent.width must: be a multiple of the block width or (pname:imageExtent.width + pname:imageOffset.x) must: equal the image subresource width
*   pname:imageExtent.height must: be a multiple of the block height or (pname:imageExtent.height + pname:imageOffset.y) must: equal the image subresource height
*   pname:imageExtent.depth must: be a multiple of the block depth or (pname:imageExtent.depth + pname:imageOffset.z) must: equal the image subresource depth
* pname:bufferOffset, pname:bufferRowLength, pname:bufferImageHeight and all members of pname:imageOffset and pname:imageExtent must: respect the image transfer granularity requirements of the queue family that it will be submitted against, as described in <<execution-physical-device-enumeration,Physical Device Enumeration>>
* The pname:aspectMask member of pname:srcSubresource must: specify aspects present in the calling command's sname:VkImage parameter
* The pname:aspectMask member of pname:pSubresource must: only have a single bit set
* If the calling command's sname:VkImage parameter is of elink:VkImageType ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D, the pname:baseArrayLayer and pname:layerCount members of both pname:srcSubresource and pname:dstSubresource must: be `0` and `1`, respectively
