* pname:minImageCount must: be greater than or equal to the value returned in the pname:minImageCount member of the sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface
* pname:minImageCount must: be less than or equal to the value returned in the pname:maxImageCount member of the sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface if the returned value of pname:maxImageCount is not zero
* pname:imageFormat and pname:imageColorspace must: match the pname:format and pname:colorSpace members, respectively, of one of the sname:VkSurfaceFormatKHR structures returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR for the surface
* pname:imageExtent must: be between pname:minImageExtent and pname:maxImageExtent, inclusive, where pname:minImageExtent and pname:maxImageExtent are members of the sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface
* pname:imageArrayLayers must: be greater than `0` and less than or equal to the pname:maxImageArrayLayers member of the sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface
* pname:imageUsage must: be a subset of the supported usage flags present in the pname:supportedUsageFlags member of the sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface
* If pname:imageSharingMode is ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT, pname:pQueueFamilyIndices must: be a pointer to an array of pname:queueFamilyIndexCount basetype:uint32_t values
