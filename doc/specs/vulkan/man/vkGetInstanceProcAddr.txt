vkGetInstanceProcAddr(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkGetInstanceProcAddr - Return a function pointer for a command

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetInstanceProcAddr.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:instance::
    The instance whose function pointer to query

pname:pName::
    The name of the command

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr returns a function pointer for the command
specified in pname:pName as it corresponds to pname:instance. Depending on the
operating system, supporting components, software environment and hardware
topology, the address returned for a single command name may be different for
different values of pname:instance.

If pname:instance is code:NULL, fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr will return
non-code:NULL function pointers for the global commands
fname::vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties,
fname:vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties, and fname:vkCreateInstance. It will
return code:NULL for all other commands, since they may have different
implementations in different instances.

If pname:instance is a valid instance, fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr will return
a non-code:NULL function pointer for any core command except the global
commands listed previously. It will also return non-code:NULL for any extension
command, if there is a layer or driver available that implements the extension.

The function pointers returned by fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr may be used with
any object of the appropriate type derived from the pname:instance. For
example, the function pointer for a command with a sname:VkDevice first
parameter can be used with any sname:VkDevice object created from physical
devices belonging to the instance.

Return Value
------------

Upon success, fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr returns the address
(code:PFN_vkVoidFunction) of the command whose name is specified by pname:pName.
If pname:pName is not supported by the Vulkan library, then
fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr returns code:NULL.
