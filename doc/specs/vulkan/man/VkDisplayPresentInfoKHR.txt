VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR - Structure describing parameters of a queue presentation to a swapchain

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR - Structure describing parameters of a queue presentation to a swapchain

The sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../structs/VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DISPLAY_PRESENT_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcRect is a rectangular region of pixels to present. It must: be
    a subset of the image being presented. If sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR
    is not specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire
    presentable image.
  * pname:dstRect is a rectangular region within the visible region of the
    swapchain's display mode. If sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not
    specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire visible region
    of the visible region of the swapchain's mode. If the specified
    rectangle is a subset of the display mode's visible region, content from
    display planes below the swapchain's plane will be visible outside the
    rectangle. If there are no planes below the swapchain's, the area
    outside the specified rectangle will be black. If portions of the
    specified rectangle are outside of the display's visible region, pixels
    mapping only to those portions of the rectangle will be discarded.
  * pname:persistent: If this is ename:VK_TRUE, the display engine will
    enable buffered mode on displays that support it. This allows the
    display engine to stop sending content to the display until a new image
    is presented. The display will instead maintain a copy of the last
    presented image. This allows less power to be used, but may: increase
    presentation latency. If sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not specified,
    persistent mode will not be used.


Description
-----------

If the extent of the pname:srcRect and pname:dstRect are not equal, the
presented pixels will be scaled accordingly.
