vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices - Enumerates the physical devices accessible to a Vulkan instance.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:instance::
    A handle to the instance to be used to enumerate devices.

pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount::
    A pointer to a variable containing the maximum number of devices to enumerate.

pname:pPhysicalDevices::
    A pointer to an array that will be filled with handles to the enumerated devices.

Description
-----------

fname:vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices generates a list of the physical devices accessible to the
instance of Vulkan specified in pname:instance.

pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is a pointer to a variable which contains the number of devices to
enumerate. pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount must not be code:NULL. pname:pPhysicalDevices is a
pointer to an array of sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles which will be filled with handles
to the enumerated devices.

If pname:pPhysicalDevices is code:NULL, then the initial value of the variable pointed to
by pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is ignored and this variable is overwritten with the number of
physical devices accessible to pname:instance.

If pname:pPhysicalDevices is not code:NULL, then pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount should point
to a variable that has been initialized with the size of the array pointed to by pname:pPhysicalDevices.
No more than this number of physical device handles will be written into the output array.
The actual number of device handles written into pname:pPhysicalDevices is then written into
the variable pointed to pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount.
