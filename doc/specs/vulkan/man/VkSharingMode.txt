Name
----
VkSharingMode - Buffer and image sharing modes

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSharingMode - Buffer and image sharing modes

Buffer and image objects are created with a _sharing mode_ controlling how
they can: be accessed from queues. The supported sharing modes are:

include::../api/enums/VkSharingMode.txt[]


Description
-----------

  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE specifies that access to any range or
    image subresource of the object will be exclusive to a single queue
    family at a time.
  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT specifies that concurrent access to any
    range or image subresource of the object from multiple queue families is
    supported.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT may: result in lower performance access to
the buffer or image than ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE.
====

Ranges of buffers and image subresources of image objects created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE must: only be accessed by queues in the same
queue family at any given time. In order for a different queue family to be
able to interpret the memory contents of a range or image subresource, the
application must: transfer exclusive ownership of the range or image
subresource between the source and destination queue families with the
following sequence of operations:

1. Release exclusive ownership from the source queue family to the
   destination queue family.
2. Use semaphores to ensure proper execution control for the ownership
   transfer.
3. Acquire exclusive ownership for the destination queue family from the
   source queue family.

To release exclusive ownership of a range of a buffer or image subresource
of an image object, the application must: execute a buffer or image memory
barrier, respectively (see slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier and
slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier) on a queue from the source queue family. The
pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex parameter of the barrier must: be set to the
source queue family index, and the pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex parameter to
the destination queue family index.

To acquire exclusive ownership, the application must: execute the same
buffer or image memory barrier on a queue from the destination queue family.

Upon creation, resources using ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE are not owned
by any queue family. A buffer or image memory barrier is not required to
acquire ownership when no queue family owns the resource - it is implicitly
acquired upon first use within a queue. However, images still require a
<<resources-image-layouts,layout transition>> from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED
before being used on the first queue. This layout transition can: either be
accomplished by an image memory barrier or by use in a render pass instance.

Once a queue family has used a range or image subresource of an
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE resource, its contents are undefined to
other queue families unless ownership is transferred. The contents may: also
become undefined for other reasons, e.g. as a result of writes to an image
subresource that aliases the same memory. A queue family can: take ownership
of a range or image subresource without an ownership transfer in the same
way as for a resource that was just created, however doing so means any
contents written by other queue families or via incompatible aliases are
undefined.
