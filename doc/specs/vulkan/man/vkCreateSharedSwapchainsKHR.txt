vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR(3)
==============================

Name
----
vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR - Create multiple swapchains that share presentable images

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR - Create multiple swapchains that share presentable images

When the VK_KHR_display_swapchain extension is enabled, multiple swapchains
that share presentable images are created by calling:

include::../../protos/vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the device to create the swapchains for.
  * pname:swapchainCount is the number of swapchains to create.
  * pname:pCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structures specifying the parameters of
    the created swapchains.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    swapchain objects when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSwapchains is a pointer to an array of sname:VkSwapchainKHR
    handles in which the created swapchain objects will be returned.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCreateSharedSwapchains is similar to flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR,
except that it takes an array of sname:VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structures,
and returns an array of swapchain objects.

The swapchain creation parameters that affect the
properties and number of presentable images must: match between all the
swapchains. If the displays used by any of the swapchains do not use the same
presentable image layout or are incompatible in a way that prevents sharing
images, swapchain creation will fail with the result code
ename:VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DISPLAY_KHR. If any error occurs, no swapchains
will be created. Images presented to multiple swapchains must: be re-acquired
from all of them before transitioning away from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR. After destroying one or more of the
swapchains, the remaining swapchains and the presentable images can: continue
to be used.
