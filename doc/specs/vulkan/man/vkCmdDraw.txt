---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdDraw.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which the drawing command is to be placed.

pname:firstVertex::
    The first vertex to be passed to the graphics pipeline.

pname:vertexCount::
    The number of vertices passed to the graphics pipeline.

pname:firstInstance::
    The first instance of data to be passed to the graphice pipeline.

pname:instanceCount::
    The number of instances to be passed to the graphics pipeline.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDraw invokes a draw in the bound graphics pipeline. pname:instanceCount instances
of pname:vertexCount vertices are produced. The vertex index presented to the pipeline
is automatically generated, starting from pname:firstVertex and counting forwards. For
each instance, the instance index is generated automaticall, starting from pname:firstInstance
and counting forwards. If pname:vertexCount or pname:vertexCount is zero, then no vertices are
generated.

validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
