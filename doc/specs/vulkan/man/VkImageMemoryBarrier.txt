VkImageMemoryBarrier(3)
=======================

Name
----
VkImageMemoryBarrier - Structure specifying the parameters of an image memory barrier.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageMemoryBarrier Structure specifying the parameters of an image memory barrier.

The sname:VkImageMemoryBarrier structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageMemoryBarrier.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcAccessMask is a bitmask of the classes of memory accesses
    performed by the first set of commands that will participate in
    the dependency.
  * pname:dstAccessMask is a bitmask of the classes of memory accesses
    performed by the second set of commands that will participate in
    the dependency.
  * pname:oldLayout describes the current layout of the image
    subresource(s).
  * pname:newLayout describes the new layout of the image subresource(s).
  * pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is the queue family that is relinquishing
    ownership of the image subresource(s) to another queue, or
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED if there is no transfer of ownership).
  * pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is the queue family that is acquiring
    ownership of the image subresource(s) from another queue, or
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED if there is no transfer of ownership).
  * pname:image is a handle to the image whose backing memory is affected by
    the barrier.
  * pname:subresourceRange describes an area of the backing memory for
    pname:image (see <<resources-image-views>> for the description of
    sname:VkImageSubresourceRange), as well as the set of image subresources
    whose image layouts are modified.


Description
-----------

If pname:oldLayout differs from pname:newLayout, a layout transition occurs
as part of the image memory barrier, affecting the data contained in the
region of the image defined by the pname:subresourceRange. If
pname:oldLayout is ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, then the data is
undefined after the layout transition. This may: allow a more efficient
transition, since the data may: be discarded. The layout transition must:
occur after all operations using the old layout are completed and before all
operations using the new layout are started. This is achieved by ensuring
that there is a memory dependency between previous accesses and the layout
transition, as well as between the layout transition and subsequent
accesses, where the layout transition occurs between the two halves of a
memory dependency in an image memory barrier.

Layout transitions that are performed via image memory barriers are
automatically ordered against other layout transitions, including those that
occur as part of a render pass instance.
