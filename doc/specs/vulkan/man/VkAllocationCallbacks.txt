VkAllocationCallbacks(3)
========================

Name
----
VkAllocationCallbacks - Structure containing callback function pointers for memory allocation.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkAllocationCallbacks Structure containing callback function pointers for memory allocation.

Allocators are provided by the application as a pointer to a
sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structure:

include::../structs/VkAllocationCallbacks.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:pUserData is a value to be interpreted by the implementation of
    the callbacks. When any of the callbacks in sname:VkAllocationCallbacks
    are called, the Vulkan implementation will pass this value as the
    first parameter to the callback. This value can: vary each time an
    allocator is passed into a command, even when the same object takes an
    allocator in multiple commands.
  * pname:pfnAllocation is a pointer to an application-defined memory
    allocation function of type tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction.
  * pname:pfnReallocation is a pointer to an application-defined memory
    reallocation function of type tlink:PFN_vkReallocationFunction.
  * pname:pfnFree is a pointer to an application-defined memory free
    function of type tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction.
  * pname:pfnInternalAllocation is a pointer to an application-defined
    function that is called by the implementation when the implementation
    makes internal allocations, and it is of type
    tlink:PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification.
  * pname:pfnInternalFree is a pointer to an application-defined function
    that is called by the implementation when the implementation frees
    internal allocations, and it is of type
    tlink:PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification.
