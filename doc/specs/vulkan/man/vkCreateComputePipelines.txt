vkCreateComputePipelines(3)
===========================

Name
----
vkCreateComputePipelines - Creates a new compute pipeline object.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCreateComputePipelines.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the device to use to create the new compute pipelines.

pname:pipelineCache::
    A handle to a pipeline cache from which the result of previous compiles may
    be retrieved, and to which the result of this compile may be stored.

pname:createInfoCount::
    The number of pipelines to create.

pname:pCreateInfos::
    Pointer to an array of pname:createInfoCount
    sname:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structures defining the contents of
    the new pipelines.

pname:pPipelines::
    A pointer to an array to receive the handles to the new compute pipeline
    objects.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCreateComputePipelines creates new compute pipeline objects using the device specified in
pname:device and the creation information specified in the structures pointed to by pname:pCreateInfos and
deposits the resulting handles in the array pointed to by pname:pPipelines. The definition
of slink:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo is:

include::../structs/VkComputePipelineCreateInfo.txt[]

.Create Info Details

-  pname:sType indicates the type of this structure and must be
ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMPUTE_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO.

- pname:pNext is a pointer to an extension-specific structure (can be NULL).

- pname:stage is a sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo describing the
compute shader.

- pname:flags controls how the driver will create the pipeline.

- pname:layout the description of binding locations used by both the
pipeline and the descritor sets.

- pname:basePipelineHandle the pipeline to derive from (can be
  code:VK_NULL_HANDLE, if pipeline is not derived).

- pname:basePipelineIndex the index into the pname:pCreateInfos parameter
to fname:vkCreateComputePipelines.

The parameters pname:basePipelineHandle and pname:basePipelineIndex are ignored
unless pname:flags has the ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT bit set. If
using the pname:basePipelineIndex parameter, the index must refer to a
pname:pCreateInfos parameter passed to vkCreateComputePipelines that appeared
earlier than the current sname:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo in the list. The
parameters pname:basePipelineHandle and pname:basePipelineIndex are mutually
exclusive. If you specify a valid pname:basePipelineHandle,
pname:basePipelineIndex must be set to -1. If you specify a valid
pname:basePipelineIndex, pname:basePipelineHandle must be code:VK_NULL_HANDLE.
