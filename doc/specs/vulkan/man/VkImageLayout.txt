// refBegin VkImageLayout - Layout of image and image subresources

The set of image layouts consists of:

include::../enums/VkImageLayout.txt[]


Description
-----------

The type(s) of device access supported by each layout are:

  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED: Supports no device access. This layout
    must: only be used as an pname:initialLayout or as the pname:oldLayout
    in an image transition. When transitioning out of this layout, the
    contents of the memory are not guaranteed to be preserved.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED: Supports no device access. This
    layout must: only be used as an pname:initialLayout or as the
    pname:oldLayout in an image transition. When transitioning out of this
    layout, the contents of the memory are preserved. This
    layout is intended to be used as the initial layout for an image whose
    contents are written by the host, and hence the data can: be written to
    memory immediately, without first executing a layout transition.
    Currently, ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED is only useful with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR images because there is not a standard
    layout defined for ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL images.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL: Supports all types of device access.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    color or resolve attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer. This layout is
    valid only for image subresources of images created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL: must: only be
    used as a depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer. This layout
    is valid only for image subresources of images created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL: must: only be
    used as a read-only depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer
    and/or as a read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled
    image, combined image/sampler and/or input attachment). This layout is
    valid only for image subresources of images created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled image,
    combined image/sampler and/or input attachment). This layout is valid
    only for image subresources of images created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT or
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    source image of a transfer command (see the definition of
    <<synchronization-transfer,ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT>>).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    destination image of a transfer command. This layout is valid only for
    image subresources of images created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT usage bit enabled.

For each mechanism of accessing an image in the API, there is a parameter or
structure member that controls the image layout used to access the image.
For transfer commands, this is a parameter to the command (see <<clears>>
and <<copies>>). For use as a framebuffer attachment, this is a member in
the substructures of the sname:VkRenderPassCreateInfo (see
<<renderpass,Render Pass>>). For use in a descriptor set, this is a member
in the sname:VkDescriptorImageInfo structure (see
<<descriptorsets-updates>>). At the time that any command buffer command
accessing an image executes on any queue, the layouts of the image
subresources that are accessed must: all match the layout specified via the
API controlling those accesses.

The image layout of each image subresource must: be well-defined at each
point in the image subresource's lifetime. This means that when performing a
layout transition on the image subresource, the old layout value must:
either equal the current layout of the image subresource (at the time the
transition executes), or else be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED (implying
that the contents of the image subresource need not be preserved). The new
layout used in a transition mustnot: be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.
