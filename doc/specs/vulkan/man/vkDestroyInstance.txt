====================

Name

vkDestroyInstance - Destroy an instance of Vulkan.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyInstance.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:instance::
    Vulkan instance to release.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyInstance destroys an instance of Vulkan. After destruction of the instance,
all devices (logical and physical) and any objects created by those devices become in valid
and should not be accessed. However, objects allocated directly or indirectly through
the instance are not destroyed automatically and so may be leaked. Applications should destroy
all objects created through pname:instance before destroying the instance itself.
