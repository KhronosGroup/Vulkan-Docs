C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdCopyBuffer.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which the copy command is to be placed.

pname:srcBuffer::
    The buffer containing the data to be copied.

pname:dstBuffer::
    The buffer into which data will be copied.

pname:regionCount::
    The number of regions of data to copy.

pname:pRegions::
    An array of pname:regionCount regions of data to be copied.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdCopyBuffer copies regions of data from a source buffer to a destination

region is represented by a member of the pname:pRegions array, which is an array of
the slink:VkBufferCopy structure, whose definition is:

include::../structs/VkBufferCopy.txt[]

If any two or more regions within pname:pRegions overlap, the resulting data will be
undefined. It is recommended, but not required, that the regions given in pname:pRegions
start on multiples of four bytes and have a length which is a multiple of four bytes.
