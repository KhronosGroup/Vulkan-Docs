[[pipelines]]
= Pipelines

The following <<pipelines-block-diagram,figure>> shows a block diagram of
the Vulkan pipelines.
Some Vulkan commands specify geometric objects to be drawn or computational
work to be performed, while others specify state controlling how objects are
handled by the various pipeline stages, or control data transfer between
memory organized as images and buffers.
Commands are effectively sent through a processing pipeline, either a
_graphics pipeline_ or a _compute pipeline_.

The first stage of the <<pipelines-graphics,graphics pipeline>>
(<<drawing,Input Assembler>>) assembles vertices to form geometric
primitives such as points, lines, and triangles, based on a requested
primitive topology.
In the next stage (<<shaders-vertex,Vertex Shader>>) vertices can: be
transformed, computing positions and attributes for each vertex.
If <<tessellation,tessellation>> and/or <<geometry,geometry>> shaders are
supported, they can: then generate multiple primitives from a single input
primitive, possibly changing the primitive topology or generating additional
attribute data in the process.

The final resulting primitives are <<vertexpostproc-clipping,clipped>> to a
clip volume in preparation for the next stage, <<primsrast,Rasterization>>.
The rasterizer produces a series of framebuffer addresses and values using a
two-dimensional description of a point, line segment, or triangle.
Each _fragment_ so produced is fed to the next stage
(<<shaders-fragment,Fragment Shader>>) that performs operations on
individual fragments before they finally alter the framebuffer.
These operations include conditional updates into the framebuffer based on
incoming and previously stored depth values (to effect <<fragops-depth,depth
buffering>>), <<framebuffer-blending,blending>> of incoming fragment colors
with stored colors, as well as <<framebuffer-blendoperations,masking>>,
<<fragops-stencil,stenciling>>, and other <<framebuffer-logicop,logical
operations>> on fragment values.

Framebuffer operations read and write the color and depth/stencil
attachments of the framebuffer for a given subpass of a <<renderpass,render
pass instance>>.
The attachments can: be used as input attachments in the fragment shader in
a later subpass of the same render pass.

The <<pipelines-compute,compute pipeline>> is a separate pipeline from the
graphics pipeline, which operates on one-, two-, or three-dimensional
workgroups which can: read from and write to buffer and image memory.

This ordering is meant only as a tool for describing Vulkan, not as a strict
rule of how Vulkan is implemented, and we present it only as a means to
organize the various operations of the pipelines.
Actual ordering guarantees between pipeline stages are explained in detail
in the <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, synchronization chapter>>.

[[pipelines-block-diagram]]
image::images/pipeline.svg[title="Block diagram of the Vulkan pipeline",{fullimagewidth},align="center"]

Each pipeline is controlled by a monolithic object created from a
description of all of the shader stages and any relevant fixed-function
stages.
<<interfaces,Linking>> the whole pipeline together allows the optimization
of shaders based on their input/outputs and eliminates expensive draw time
state validation.

A pipeline object is bound to the device state in command buffers.
Any pipeline object state that is marked as dynamic is not applied to the
device state when the pipeline is bound.
Dynamic state not set by binding the pipeline object can: be modified at any
time and persists for the lifetime of the command buffer, or until modified
by another dynamic state command or another pipeline bind.
No state, including dynamic state, is inherited from one command buffer to
another.
Only dynamic state that is required: for the operations performed in the
command buffer needs to be set.
For example, if blending is disabled by the pipeline state then the dynamic
color blend constants do not need to be specified in the command buffer,
even if this state is marked as dynamic in the pipeline state object.
If a new pipeline object is bound with state not marked as dynamic after a
previous pipeline object with that same state as dynamic, the new pipeline
object state will override the dynamic state.
Modifying dynamic state that is not set as dynamic by the pipeline state
object will lead to undefined results.

== Compute Pipelines

Compute pipelines consist of a single static compute shader stage and the
pipeline layout.

The compute pipeline represents a compute shader and is created by calling
fname:vkCreateComputePipelines with pname:module and pname:pName selecting
an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point defines a valid
compute shader, in the sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure
contained within the sname:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structure.

include::../api/protos/vkCreateComputePipelines.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the compute pipelines.
  * pname:pipelineCache is either dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, indicating that
    pipeline caching is disabled; or the handle of a valid
    <<pipelines-cache,pipeline cache>> object, in which case use of that
    cache is enabled for the duration of the command.
  * pname:createInfoCount is the length of the pname:pCreateInfos and
    pname:pPipelines arrays.

=== Valid Combinations of Stages for Graphics Pipelines

If tessellation shader stages are omitted, the tessellation shading and
fixed-function stages of the pipeline are skipped.

If a geometry shader is omitted, the geometry shading stage is skipped.

If a fragment shader is omitted, the results of fragment processing are
undefined.
Specifically, any fragment color outputs are considered to have undefined
values, and the fragment depth is considered to be unmodified.
This can: be useful for depth-only rendering.

Presence of a shader stage in a pipeline is indicated by including a valid
sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo with pname:module and pname:pName
selecting an entry point from a shader module, where that entry point is
valid for the stage specified by pname:stage.

Presence of some of the fixed-function stages in the pipeline is implicitly
derived from enabled shaders and provided state.
For example, the fixed-function tessellator is always present when the
pipeline has valid Tessellation Control and Tessellation Evaluation shaders.

.For example:
  * Depth/stencil-only rendering in a subpass with no color attachments
  ** Active Pipeline Shader Stages
  *** Vertex Shader
  ** Required: Fixed-Function Pipeline Stages
  *** slink:VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo
  *** slink:VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo
  *** slink:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo

[[pipelines-destruction]]
== Pipeline destruction

// refBegin vkDestroyPipeline Destroy a pipeline object

To destroy a graphics or compute pipeline, call:

include::../api/protos/vkDestroyPipeline.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that destroys the pipeline.
  * pname:pipeline is the handle of the pipeline to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

.Valid Usage
****
  * All submitted commands that refer to pname:pipeline must: have completed
    execution
  * If sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:pipeline was
    created, a compatible set of callbacks must: be provided here
  * If no sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:pipeline was
    created, pname:pAllocator must: be `NULL`
****

[[pipelines-multiple]]
== Multiple Pipeline Creation

Multiple pipelines can: be created simultaneously by passing an array of
sname:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo or sname:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo
structures into the flink:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines and
flink:vkCreateComputePipelines commands, respectively.
Applications can: group together similar pipelines to be created in a single
call, and implementations are encouraged to look for reuse opportunities
within a group-create.

When an application attempts to create many pipelines in a single command,
it is possible that some subset may: fail creation.
In that case, the corresponding entries in the pname:pPipelines output array
will be filled with dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values.
If any pipeline fails creation (for example, due to out of memory errors),
the ftext:vkCreate*Pipelines commands will return an error code.
The implementation will attempt to create all pipelines, and only return
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE values for those that actually failed.


[[pipelines-pipeline-derivatives]]
== Pipeline Derivatives

A pipeline derivative is a child pipeline created from a parent pipeline,
where the child and parent are expected to have much commonality.
The goal of derivative pipelines is that they be cheaper to create using the
parent as a starting point, and that it be more efficient (on either host or
device) to switch/bind between children of the same parent.

A derivative pipeline is created by setting the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag in the
stext:Vk*PipelineCreateInfo structure.
If this is set, then exactly one of pname:basePipelineHandle or
pname:basePipelineIndex members of the structure must: have a valid
handle/index, and indicates the parent pipeline.
If pname:basePipelineHandle is used, the parent pipeline must: have already
been created.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, then the parent is being created in the
same command.
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE acts as the invalid handle for
pname:basePipelineHandle, and -1 is the invalid index for
pname:basePipelineIndex.
If pname:basePipelineIndex is used, the base pipeline must: appear earlier
in the array.
The base pipeline must: have been created with the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT flag set.


[[pipelines-cache]]
== Pipeline Cache

// refBegin VkPipelineCache Opaque handle to a pipeline cache object

Pipeline cache objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be
reused between pipelines and between runs of an application.
Reuse between pipelines is achieved by passing the same pipeline cache
object when creating multiple related pipelines.
Reuse across runs of an application is achieved by retrieving pipeline cache
contents in one run of an application, saving the contents, and using them
to preinitialize a pipeline cache on a subsequent run.
The contents of the pipeline cache objects are managed by the
implementation.
Applications can: manage the host memory consumed by a pipeline cache object
and control the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache object.

Pipeline cache objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineCache handles:

include::../api/handles/VkPipelineCache.txt[]

// refEnd VkPipelineCache

// refBegin vkCreatePipelineCache Creates a new pipeline cache

To create pipeline cache objects, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreatePipelineCache.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the pipeline cache
    object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a sname:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo
    structure that contains the initial parameters for the pipeline cache
    object.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelineCache is a pointer to a sname:VkPipelineCache handle in
    which the resulting pipeline cache object is returned.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Applications can: track and manage the total host memory size of a pipeline
cache object using the pname:pAllocator.
Applications can: limit the amount of data retrieved from a pipeline cache
object in fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData.
Implementations should: not internally limit the total number of entries
added to a pipeline cache object or the total host memory consumed.
====

Once created, a pipeline cache can: be passed to the
fname:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines and fname:vkCreateComputePipelines commands.
If the pipeline cache passed into these commands is not
dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, the implementation will query it for possible reuse
opportunities and update it with new content.
The use of the pipeline cache object in these commands is internally
synchronized, and the same pipeline cache object can: be used in multiple
threads simultaneously.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Implementations should: make every effort to limit any critical sections to
the actual accesses to the cache, which is expected to be significantly
shorter than the duration of the fname:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines and
fname:vkCreateComputePipelines commands.
====

include::../validity/protos/vkCreatePipelineCache.txt[]

// refBegin VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline cache

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:initialDataSize is the number of bytes in pname:pInitialData.
    If pname:initialDataSize is zero, the pipeline cache will initially be
    empty.
  * pname:pInitialData is a pointer to previously retrieved pipeline cache
    data.
    If the pipeline cache data is incompatible (as defined below) with the
    device, the pipeline cache will be initially empty.
    If pname:initialDataSize is zero, pname:pInitialData is ignored.

.Valid Usage
****
  * If pname:initialDataSize is not `0`, it must: be equal to the size of
    pname:pInitialData, as returned by fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData when
    pname:pInitialData was originally retrieved
  * If pname:initialDataSize is not `0`, pname:pInitialData must: have been
    retrieved from a previous call to fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData

    into.
  * pname:srcCacheCount is the length of the pname:pSrcCaches array.
  * pname:pSrcCaches is an array of pipeline cache handles, which will be
    merged into pname:dstCache.
    The previous contents of pname:dstCache are included after the merge.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The details of the merge operation are implementation dependent, but
implementations should: merge the contents of the specified pipelines and
prune duplicate entries.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:dstCache must: not appear in the list of source caches
****

include::../validity/protos/vkMergePipelineCaches.txt[]

// refBegin vkGetPipelineCacheData Get the data store from a pipeline cache

Data can: be retrieved from a pipeline cache object using the command:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPipelineCacheData.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the pipeline cache.
  * pname:pipelineCache is the pipeline cache to retrieve data from.
  * pname:pDataSize is a pointer to a value related to the amount of data in
    the pipeline cache, as described below.
  * pname:pData is either `NULL` or a pointer to a buffer.

If pname:pData is `NULL`, then the maximum size of the data that can: be
retrieved from the pipeline cache, in bytes, is returned in pname:pDataSize.
Otherwise, pname:pDataSize must: point to a variable set by the user to the
size of the buffer, in bytes, pointed to by pname:pData, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the amount of data actually written to
pname:pData.

If pname:pDataSize is less than the maximum size that can: be retrieved by
the pipeline cache, at most pname:pDataSize bytes will be written to
pname:pData, and fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData will return
ename:VK_INCOMPLETE.
Any data written to pname:pData is valid and can: be provided as the
pname:pInitialData member of the sname:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo structure
passed to fname:vkCreatePipelineCache.

Two calls to fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData with the same parameters must:
retrieve the same data unless a command that modifies the contents of the
cache is called between them.

[[pipelines-cache-header]]
Applications can: store the data retrieved from the pipeline cache, and use
these data, possibly in a future run of the application, to populate new
pipeline cache objects.
The results of pipeline compiles, however, may: depend on the vendor ID,
device ID, driver version, and other details of the device.
To enable applications to detect when previously retrieved data is
incompatible with the device, the initial bytes written to pname:pData must:
be a header consisting of the following members:

.Layout for pipeline cache header version ename:VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_HEADER_VERSION_ONE
[width="85%",cols="8%,21%,71%",options="header"]
|====
| Offset | Size | Meaning
| 0 | 4                    | length in bytes of the entire pipeline cache header

                             written as a stream of bytes, with the least
                             significant byte first
| 8 | 4                    | a vendor ID equal to
                             sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:vendorID
                             written as a stream of bytes, with the least

                             sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::pname:pipelineCacheUUID
|====

The first four bytes encode the length of the entire pipeline header, in
bytes.
This value includes all fields in the header including the pipeline cache
version field and the size of the length field.

// refBegin VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersion Encode pipeline cache version

The next four bytes encode the pipeline cache version.
This field is interpreted as a elink:VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersion value, and
must: have one of the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersion.txt[]

A consumer of the pipeline cache should: use the cache version to interpret
the remainder of the cache header.

// refEnd VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersion vkCreatePipelineCache vkGetPipelineCacheData

If pname:pDataSize is less than what is necessary to store this header,
nothing will be written to pname:pData and zero will be written to
pname:pDataSize.

[[pipelines-specialization-constants]]
== Specialization Constants

Specialization constants are a mechanism whereby constants in a SPIR-V
module can: have their constant value specified at the time the
sname:VkPipeline is created.
This allows a SPIR-V module to have constants that can: be modified while
executing an application that uses the Vulkan API.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Specialization constants are useful to allow a compute shader to have its
local workgroup size changed at runtime by the user, for example.
====

Each instance of the sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure
contains a parameter pname:pSpecializationInfo, which can: be `NULL` to
indicate no specialization constants, or point to a
sname:VkSpecializationInfo structure.

// refBegin VkSpecializationInfo Structure specifying specialization info

The sname:VkSpecializationInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkSpecializationInfo.txt[]

  * pname:mapEntryCount is the number of entries in the pname:pMapEntries
    array.
  * pname:pMapEntries is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry which maps constant IDs to offsets in
    pname:pData.
  * pname:dataSize is the byte size of the pname:pData buffer.
  * pname:pData contains the actual constant values to specialize with.

pname:pMapEntries points to a structure of type
slink:VkSpecializationMapEntry.

.Valid Usage
****
  * The pname:offset member of any given element of pname:pMapEntries must:
    be less than pname:dataSize
  * For any given element of pname:pMapEntries, pname:size must: be less
    than or equal to pname:dataSize minus pname:offset
  * If pname:mapEntryCount is not `0`, pname:pMapEntries must: be a pointer
    to an array of pname:mapEntryCount valid sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry
    structures
****

include::../validity/structs/VkSpecializationInfo.txt[]

// refBegin VkSpecializationMapEntry Structure specifying a specialization map entry

The sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkSpecializationMapEntry.txt[]

  * pname:constantID is the ID of the specialization constant in SPIR-V.
  * pname:offset is the byte offset of the specialization constant value
    within the supplied data buffer.
  * pname:size is the byte size of the specialization constant value within
    the supplied data buffer.

If a pname:constantID value is not a specialization constant ID used in the
shader, that map entry does not affect the behavior of the pipeline.

.Valid Usage
****
  * For a pname:constantID specialization constant declared in a shader,
    pname:size must: match the byte size of the pname:constantID.
    If the specialization constant is of type code:boolean, pname:size must:
    be the byte size of basetype:VkBool32

OpDecorate %wgsize BuiltIn WorkgroupSize ; decorate WorkgroupSize onto constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 0 ; declare an unsigned 32-bit type

%x = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .x component of WorkgroupSize
%y = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .y component of WorkgroupSize
%z = OpSpecConstant %i32 1 ; declare the .z component of WorkgroupSize
%wgsize = OpSpecConstantComposite %uvec3 %x %y %z ; declare WorkgroupSize

        1 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    },
    {
        3,                              // constantID
        2 * sizeof(uint32_t),           // offset
        sizeof(uint32_t)                // size
    }
};

const uint32_t data[] = { 16, 8, 4 }; // our workgroup size is 16x8x4

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    3,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    3 * sizeof(uint32_t),               // dataSize
    data,                               // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

Then when calling flink:vkCreateComputePipelines, and passing the
sname:VkSpecializationInfo we defined as the pname:pSpecializationInfo
parameter of slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo, we will create a compute
pipeline with the runtime specified local workgroup size.

Another example would be that an application has a SPIR-V module that has
some platform-dependent constants they wish to use.

In human readable SPIR-V:

// [source,glsl]
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
OpDecorate %1 SpecId 0  ; decorate our signed 32-bit integer constant
OpDecorate %2 SpecId 12 ; decorate our 32-bit floating-point constant
%i32 = OpTypeInt 32 1   ; declare a signed 32-bit type
%float = OpTypeFloat 32 ; declare a 32-bit floating-point type
%1 = OpSpecConstant %i32 -1 ; some signed 32-bit integer constant
%2 = OpSpecConstant %float 0.5 ; some 32-bit floating-point constant
---------------------------------------------------

From the above we have two specialization constants, one is a signed 32-bit
integer and the second is a 32-bit floating-point.

Now to specialize the above via the specialization constants mechanism:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
struct SpecializationData {
    int32_t data0;
    float data1;
};

const VkSpecializationMapEntry entries[] =
{
    {
        0,                                    // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data0),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data0)     // size
    },
    {
        12,                                   // constantID
        offsetof(SpecializationData, data1),  // offset
        sizeof(SpecializationData::data1)     // size
    }
};

SpecializationData data;
data.data0 = -42;    // set the data for the 32-bit integer
data.data1 = 42.0f;  // set the data for the 32-bit floating-point

const VkSpecializationInfo info =
{
    2,                                  // mapEntryCount
    entries,                            // pMapEntries
    sizeof(data),                       // dataSize
    &data,                              // pData
};
---------------------------------------------------

It is legal for a SPIR-V module with specializations to be compiled into a
pipeline where no specialization info was provided.
SPIR-V specialization constants contain default values such that if a
specialization is not provided, the default value will be used.
In the examples above, it would be valid for an application to only
specialize some of the specialization constants within the SPIR-V module,
and let the other constants use their default values encoded within the
OpSpecConstant declarations.


[[pipelines-binding]]
== Pipeline Binding

// refBegin vkCmdBindPipeline Bind a pipeline object to a command buffer

Once a pipeline has been created, it can: be bound to the command buffer
using the command:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdBindPipeline.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer that the pipeline will be
    bound to.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint specifies the bind point, and must: have one of
    the values
+
--
// refBegin VkPipelineBindPoint Specify the bind point of a pipeline object to a command buffer
include::../api/enums/VkPipelineBindPoint.txt[]

specifying whether pname:pipeline will be bound as a compute
(ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE) or graphics
(ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS) pipeline.
There are separate bind points for each of graphics and compute, so binding
one does not disturb the other.
--
  * pname:pipeline is the pipeline to be bound.

Once bound, a pipeline binding affects subsequent graphics or compute
commands in the command buffer until a different pipeline is bound to the
bind point.
The pipeline bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE controls the
behavior of flink:vkCmdDispatch and flink:vkCmdDispatchIndirect.
The pipeline bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS controls the
behavior of flink:vkCmdDraw, flink:vkCmdDrawIndexed,
flink:vkCmdDrawIndirect, and flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect.
No other commands are affected by the pipeline state.

.Valid Usage
****
  * If pname:pipelineBindPoint is ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE, the
    sname:VkCommandPool that pname:commandBuffer was allocated from must:
    support compute operations
  * If pname:pipelineBindPoint is ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, the
    sname:VkCommandPool that pname:commandBuffer was allocated from must:
    support graphics operations
  * If pname:pipelineBindPoint is ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE,
    pname:pipeline must: be a compute pipeline
  * If pname:pipelineBindPoint is ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS,
    pname:pipeline must: be a graphics pipeline
  * If the <<features-features-variableMultisampleRate,variable multisample
    rate>> feature is not supported, pname:pipeline is a graphics pipeline,
    the current subpass has no attachments, and this is not the first call
    to this function with a graphics pipeline after transitioning to the
    current subpass, then the sample count specified by this pipeline must:
    match that set in the previous pipeline
