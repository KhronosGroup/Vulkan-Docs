[[devsandqueues]]
= 设备和队列

一旦Vulkan完成初始化，设备和队列是用来和Vulkan实现交互的主要对象。

// refBegin VkPhysicalDevice Opaque handle to a physical device object

Vulkan把 _physical_ 和 _logical_ 设备的概念分开了。一个物理设备通常表示单独的一个系统（也许由几个单独的硬件组成一起工作），
个数是有限的。逻辑设备表示从应用程序的角度看设备。

物理设备通过 sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles表示：

include::../api/handles/VkPhysicalDevice.txt[]

// refEnd VkPhysicalDevice


[[devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration]]
== 物理设备

// refBegin vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices Enumerates the physical devices accessible to a Vulkan instance

要从系统中获取表示已安装的物理设备的对象列表，可调用：

include::../api/protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

  * pname:instance is a handle to a Vulkan instance previously created with
    fname:vkCreateInstance.
  * pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of physical devices available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPhysicalDevices is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles.

如果pname:pPhysicalDevices 为 `NULL`，那么可用的物理设备的个数通过pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount返回。
否则，pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount必须指向一个用户端设置的、值为pname:pPhysicalDevices数组大小的变量，
且返回时，变量被覆写为pname:pPhysicalDevices数组的大小。
如果pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount 比可用的物理设备个数小，最多pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount被覆盖。
如果pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount 比可用的物理设备个数小，ename:VK_INCOMPLETE 将被返回，表示不是所有可用设备被返回。

include::../validity/protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties Returns properties of a physical device

要查询一个获取的物理设备的通用属性，调用：

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure, that will be filled with
    returned information.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

// refBegin VkPhysicalDeviceProperties Structure specifying physical device properties

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

  * pname:apiVersion is the version of Vulkan supported by the device,
    encoded as described in the <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version
    Numbers and Semantics>> section.
  * pname:driverVersion is the vendor-specified version of the driver.
  * pname:vendorID is a unique identifier for the _vendor_ (see below) of
    the physical device.
  * pname:deviceID is a unique identifier for the physical device among
    devices available from the vendor.
  * pname:deviceType is a elink:VkPhysicalDeviceType specifying the type of
    device.
  * pname:deviceName is a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name
    of the device.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE,
    containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier
    for the device.
  * pname:limits is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure which
    specifies device-specific limits of the physical device.
    See <<features-limits,Limits>> for details.
  * pname:sparseProperties is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties
    structure which specifies various sparse related properties of the
    physical device.
    See <<sparsememory-physicalprops,Sparse Properties>> for details.

pname:vendorID 和 pname:deviceID 域可以让应用程序适配硬件的没有通过其他Vulkan查询暴露出来的特性，
这些也可能包括性能分析，硬件勘误，或者其他的特性。在基于PCI的Vulkan实现中，pname:vendorID 和
pname:deviceID最低6位必须包含 PCI供应商和硬件设备关联的设备ID，剩下的位必须设置为0。
在非PCI实现中，渲染返回什么值可以有操作系统或者平台策略来决定。
It is otherwise at the discretion of the implementer, subject to the
following constraints and guidelines:

  * For purposes of physical device identification, the _vendor_ of a
    physical device is the entity responsible for the most salient
    characteristics of the hardware represented by the physical device
    handle.
    In the case of a discrete GPU, this should: be the GPU chipset vendor.
    In the case of a GPU or other accelerator integrated into a
    system-on-chip (SoC), this should: be the supplier of the silicon IP
    used to create the GPU or other accelerator.
  * If the vendor of the physical device has a valid PCI vendor ID issued by
    https://pcisig.com/[PCI-SIG], that ID should: be used to construct
    pname:vendorID as described above for PCI-based implementations.
    Implementations that do not return a PCI vendor ID in pname:vendorID
    must: return a valid Khronos vendor ID, obtained as described in the
    <<vulkan-styleguide,Vulkan Documentation and Extensions>> document in
    the section "`Registering a Vendor ID with Khronos`".
    Khronos vendor IDs are allocated starting at 0x10000, to distinguish
    them from the PCI vendor ID namespace.
  * The vendor of the physical device is responsible for selecting
    pname:deviceID.
    The value selected should: uniquely identify both the device version and
    any major configuration options (for example, core count in the case of
    multicore devices).
    The same device ID should: be used for all physical implementations of
    that device version and configuration.
    For example, all uses of a specific silicon IP GPU version and
    configuration should: use the same device ID, even if those uses occur
    in different SoCs.

include::../validity/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

// refBegin VkPhysicalDeviceType Supported physical device types

The physical devices types are:

include::../api/enums/VkPhysicalDeviceType.txt[]

  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER The device does not match any other
    available types.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU The device is typically one
    embedded in or tightly coupled with the host.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU The device is typically a
    separate processor connected to the host via an interlink.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU The device is typically a
    virtual node in a virtualization environment.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU The device is typically running on the
    same processors as the host.

The physical device type is advertised for informational purposes only, and
does not directly affect the operation of the system.
However, the device type may: correlate with other advertised properties or
capabilities of the system, such as how many memory heaps there are.

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to

  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support graphics operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support compute operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support transfer operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT is set, then the queues in this
    queue family support sparse memory management operations (see
    <<sparsememory,Sparse Resources>>).
    If any of the sparse resource features are enabled, then at least one
    queue family must: support this bit.

If an implementation exposes any queue family that supports graphics
operations, at least one queue family of at least one physical device
exposed by the implementation must: support both graphics and compute
operations.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
All commands that are allowed on a queue that supports transfer operations
are also allowed on a queue that supports either graphics or compute
operations thus if the capabilities of a queue family include
ename:VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT or ename:VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT then reporting the
ename:VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT capability separately for that queue family is
optional:.
====

For further details see <<devsandqueues-queues,Queues>>.

The value returned in pname:minImageTransferGranularity has a unit of
compressed texel blocks for images having a block-compressed format, and a
unit of texels otherwise.

Possible values of pname:minImageTransferGranularity are:

  * [eq]#(0,0,0)# which indicates that only whole mip levels must: be
    transferred using the image transfer operations on the corresponding
    queues.
    In this case, the following restrictions apply to all offset and extent
    parameters of image transfer operations:

  ** The pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z members of a slink:VkOffset3D
     parameter must: always be zero.
  ** The pname:width, pname:height, and pname:depth members of a
     slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: always match the width, height, and
     depth of the image subresource corresponding to the parameter,
     respectively.

  * [eq]#(A~x~, A~y~, A~z~)# where [eq]#A~x~#, [eq]#A~y~#, and [eq]#A~z~#
    are all integer powers of two.
    In this case the following restrictions apply to all image transfer
    operations:

  ** pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z of a slink:VkOffset3D parameter must: be
     integer multiples of [eq]#A~x~#, [eq]#A~y~#, and [eq]#A~z~#,
     respectively.
  ** pname:width of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~x~#, or else [eq]#pname:x + pname:width# must: equal
     the width of the image subresource corresponding to the parameter.
  ** pname:height of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~y~#, or else [eq]#pname:y + pname:height# must:
     equal the height of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** pname:depth of a slink:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of [eq]#A~z~#, or else [eq]#pname:z + pname:depth# must: equal
     the depth of the image subresource corresponding to the parameter.
  ** If the format of the image corresponding to the parameters is one of
     the block-compressed formats then for the purposes of the above
     calculations the granularity must: be scaled up by the compressed texel
     block dimensions.

Queues supporting graphics and/or compute operations must: report
[eq]#(1,1,1)# in pname:minImageTransferGranularity, meaning that there are
no additional restrictions on the granularity of image transfer operations
for these queues.
Other queues supporting image transfer operations are only required: to
support whole mip level transfers, thus pname:minImageTransferGranularity
for queues belonging to such queue families may: be [eq]#(0,0,0)#.

[[devsandqueues-devices]]
== 设备

Device objects represent logical connections to physical devices.
Each device exposes a number of _queue families_ each having one or more
_queues_.
All queues in a queue family support the same operations.

As described in <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Devices>>, a Vulkan application will first query for all physical devices in
a system.
Each physical device can: then be queried for its capabilities, including
its queue and queue family properties.
Once an acceptable physical device is identified, an application will create
a corresponding logical device.
An application must: create a separate logical device for each physical
device it will use.
The created logical device is then the primary interface to the physical
device.

How to enumerate the physical devices in a system and query those physical
devices for their queue family properties is described in the
<<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration, Physical Device Enumeration>>
section above.


[[devsandqueues-device-creation]]
=== Device Creation

// refBegin VkDevice Opaque handle to a device object

Logical devices are represented by sname:VkDevice handles:

include::../api/handles/VkDevice.txt[]

// refEnd VkDevice

// refBegin vkCreateDevice Create a new device instance

A logical device is created as a _connection_ to a physical device.
To create a logical device, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateDevice.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice must: be one of the device handles returned from a
    call to fname:vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices (see
    <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration, Physical Device
    Enumeration>>).
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure
    containing information about how to create the device.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pDevice points to a handle in which the created sname:VkDevice is
    returned.

Multiple logical devices can: be created from the same physical device.
Logical device creation may: fail due to lack of device-specific resources
(in addition to the other errors).
If that occurs, fname:vkCreateDevice will return
ename:VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateDevice.txt[]

// refBegin VkDeviceCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created device

The sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure is defined as:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:queueCreateInfoCount is the unsigned integer size of the
    pname:pQueueCreateInfos array.
    Refer to the <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section
    below for further details.
  * pname:pQueueCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures describing the queues that are
    requested to be created along with the logical device.

The following is a high-level list of sname:VkDevice uses along with
references on where to find more information:

  * Creation of queues.
    See the <<devsandqueues-queues,Queues>> section below for further
    details.
  * Creation and tracking of various synchronization constructs.

    See <<commandbuffers,Command Buffers>> for further details.
  * Creation, destruction, and management of graphics state.
    See <<pipelines,Pipelines>> and <<descriptorsets,Resource Descriptors>>,
    among others, for further details.


[[devsandqueues-lost-device]]
=== 设备丢失

A logical device may: become _lost_ because of hardware errors, execution
timeouts, power management events and/or platform-specific events.
This may: cause pending and future command execution to fail and cause
hardware resources to be corrupted.
When this happens, certain commands will return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST
(see <<fundamentals-errorcodes,Error Codes>> for a list of such commands).
After any such event, the logical device is considered _lost_.
It is not possible to reset the logical device to a non-lost state, however
the lost state is specific to a logical device (sname:VkDevice), and the
corresponding physical device (sname:VkPhysicalDevice) may: be otherwise
unaffected.
In some cases, the physical device may: also be lost, and attempting to
create a new logical device will fail, returning ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
This is usually indicative of a problem with the underlying hardware, or its
connection to the host.
If the physical device has not been lost, and a new logical device is
successfully created from that physical device, it must: be in the non-lost
state.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Whilst logical device loss may: be recoverable, in the case of physical
device loss, it is unlikely that an application will be able to recover
unless additional, unaffected physical devices exist on the system.
The error is largely informational and intended only to inform the user that
their hardware has probably developed a fault or become physically
disconnected, and should: be investigated further.
In many cases, physical device loss may: cause other more serious issues
such as the operating system crashing; in which case it may: not be reported
via the Vulkan API.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Undefined behavior caused by an application error may: cause a device to
become lost.
However, such undefined behavior may: also cause unrecoverable damage to the
process, and it is then not guaranteed that the API objects, including the
sname:VkPhysicalDevice or the sname:VkInstance are still valid or that the
error is recoverable.
====

When a device is lost, its child objects are not implicitly destroyed and
their handles are still valid.
Those objects must: still be destroyed before their parents or the device
can: be destroyed (see the <<fundamentals-objectmodel-lifetime,Object
Lifetime>> section).
The host address space corresponding to device memory mapped using
flink:vkMapMemory is still valid, and host memory accesses to these mapped
regions are still valid, but the contents are undefined.
It is still legal to call any API command on the device and child objects.

Once a device is lost, command execution may: fail, and commands that return
a elink:VkResult may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
Commands that do not allow run-time errors must: still operate correctly for
valid usage and, if applicable, return valid data.

Commands that wait indefinitely for device execution (namely
flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle, flink:vkQueueWaitIdle, flink:vkWaitForFences
ifdef::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
or flink:vkAcquireNextImageKHR
endif::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
with a maximum pname:timeout, and flink:vkGetQueryPoolResults with the
ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT bit set in pname:flags) must: return in
finite time even in the case of a lost device, and return either
ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
For any command that may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST, for the purpose
of determining whether a command buffer is pending execution, or whether
resources are considered in-use by the device, a return value of
ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST is equivalent to ename:VK_SUCCESS.

ifdef::editing-notes[]
[NOTE]
.editing-note
====
TODO (piman) - I do not think we are very clear about what "`in-use by the
device`" means.
====
endif::editing-notes[]


[[devsandqueues-destruction]]
=== 设备销毁

// refBegin vkDestroyDevice Destroy a logical device

To destroy a device, call:

include::../api/protos/vkDestroyDevice.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

To ensure that no work is active on the device, flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle can:
be used to gate the destruction of the device.
Prior to destroying a device, an application is responsible for
destroying/freeing any Vulkan objects that were created using that device as
the first parameter of the corresponding ftext:vkCreate* or
ftext:vkAllocate* command.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The lifetime of each of these objects is bound by the lifetime of the
sname:VkDevice object.
Therefore, to avoid resource leaks, it is critical that an application
explicitly free all of these resources prior to calling
fname:vkDestroyDevice.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * All child objects created on pname:device must: have been destroyed
    prior to destroying pname:device
  * If sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:device was
    created, a compatible set of callbacks must: be provided here
  * If no sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:device was
    created, pname:pAllocator must: be `NULL`

[[devsandqueues-queues]]
== 队列


[[devsandqueues-queueprops]]
=== 队列族的属性

As discussed in the <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Device Enumeration>> section above, the
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties command is used to retrieve
details about the queue families and queues supported by a device.

Each index in the pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties describes a unique queue
family on that physical device.
These indices are used when creating queues, and they correspond directly
with the pname:queueFamilyIndex that is passed to the flink:vkCreateDevice
command via the slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure as described in the
<<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below.

Grouping of queue families within a physical device is
implementation-dependent.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The general expectation is that a physical device groups all queues of
matching capabilities into a single family.
However, this is a recommendation to implementations and it is possible that
a physical device may: return two separate queue families with the same
capabilities.
====

Once an application has identified a physical device with the queue(s) that
it desires to use, it will create those queues in conjunction with a logical
device.
This is described in the following section.


[[devsandqueues-queue-creation]]
=== 创建队列

// refBegin VkQueue Opaque handle to a queue object

Creating a logical device also creates the queues associated with that
device.
The queues to create are described by a set of slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo
structures that are passed to flink:vkCreateDevice in
pname:pQueueCreateInfos.

Queues are represented by sname:VkQueue handles:

include::../api/handles/VkQueue.txt[]

// refEnd VkQueue

// refBegin VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created device queue

The sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex is an unsigned integer indicating the index of
    the queue family to create on this device.
    This index corresponds to the index of an element of the
    pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array that was returned by
    fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.
  * pname:queueCount is an unsigned integer specifying the number of queues
    to create in the queue family indicated by pname:queueFamilyIndex.
  * pname:pQueuePriorities is an array of pname:queueCount normalized
    floating point values, specifying priorities of work that will be
    submitted to each created queue.
    See <<devsandqueues-priority,Queue Priority>> for more information.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex must: be less than

[[devsandqueues-index]]
=== 队列族索引

The queue family index is used in multiple places in Vulkan in order to tie
operations to a specific family of queues.

When retrieving a handle to the queue via fname:vkGetDeviceQueue, the queue
family index is used to select which queue family to retrieve the
sname:VkQueue handle from as described in the previous section.

When creating a sname:VkCommandPool object (see
<<commandbuffers-pools,Command Pools>>), a queue family index is specified
in the slink:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure.
Command buffers from this pool can: only be submitted on queues
corresponding to this queue family.

When creating sname:VkImage (see <<resources-images,Images>>) and
sname:VkBuffer (see <<resources-buffers,Buffers>>) resources, a set of queue
families is included in the slink:VkImageCreateInfo and
slink:VkBufferCreateInfo structures to specify the queue families that can:
access the resource.

When inserting a slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier or slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier
(see <<synchronization-events>>) a source and destination queue family index
is specified to allow the ownership of a buffer or image to be transferred
from one queue family to another.
See the <<resources-sharing,Resource Sharing>> section for details.


[[devsandqueues-priority]]
=== 队列优先级

Each queue is assigned a priority, as set in the
slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures when creating the device.
The priority of each queue is a normalized floating point value between 0.0
and 1.0, which is then translated to a discrete priority level by the
implementation.
Higher values indicate a higher priority, with 0.0 being the lowest priority
and 1.0 being the highest.

Within the same device, queues with higher priority may: be allotted more
processing time than queues with lower priority.
The implementation makes no guarantees with regards to ordering or
scheduling among queues with the same priority, other than the constraints
defined by any <<synchronization, explicit synchronization primitives>>.
The implementation make no guarantees with regards to queues across
different devices.

An implementation may: allow a higher-priority queue to starve a
lower-priority queue on the same sname:VkDevice until the higher-priority
queue has no further commands to execute.
The relationship of queue priorities must: not cause queues on one VkDevice
to starve queues on another sname:VkDevice.

No specific guarantees are made about higher priority queues receiving more
processing time or better quality of service than lower priority queues.

[[devsandqueues-submission]]
=== Queue Submission

Work is submitted to a queue via _queue submission_ commands such as
flink:vkQueueSubmit.
Queue submission commands define a set of _queue operations_ to be executed
by the underlying physical device, including synchronization with semaphores
and fences.

Submission commands take as parameters a target queue, zero or more
_batches_ of work, and an optional fence to signal upon completion.
Each batch consists of three distinct parts:

  . Zero or more semaphores to wait on before execution of the rest of the
    batch.
  ** If present, these describe a <<synchronization-semaphores-waiting,
     semaphore wait operation>>.
  . Zero or more work items to execute.
  ** If present, these describe a _queue operation_ matching the work
     described.
  . Zero or more semaphores to signal upon completion of the work items.
  ** If present, these describe a <<synchronization-semaphores-signaling,
     semaphore signal operation>>.

If a fence is present in a queue submission, it describes a
<<synchronization-fences-signaling, fence signal operation>>.

All work described by a queue submission command must: be submitted to the
queue before the command returns.


[[devsandqueues-sparsebinding]]
==== 稀疏内存绑定

In Vulkan it is possible to sparsely bind memory to buffers and images as
described in the <<sparsememory,Sparse Resource>> chapter.
Sparse memory binding is a queue operation.
A queue whose flags include the ename:VK_QUEUE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT must: be
able to support the mapping of a virtual address to a physical address on
the device.
This causes an update to the page table mappings on the device.
This update must: be synchronized on a queue to avoid corrupting page table
mappings during execution of graphics commands.
By binding the sparse memory resources on queues, all commands that are
dependent on the updated bindings are synchronized to only execute after the
binding is updated.
See the <<synchronization,Synchronization and Cache Control>> chapter for
how this synchronization is accomplished.


[[devsandqueues-queuedestruction]]
=== 队列销毁

Queues are created along with a logical device during fname:vkCreateDevice.
All queues associated with a logical device are destroyed when
fname:vkDestroyDevice is called on that device.
