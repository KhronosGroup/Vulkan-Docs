[[devsandqueues]]
= Devices and Queues

Once {apiname} is initialized, devices and queues are the primary objects
used to interact with a {apiname} implementation.

{apiname} separates the concept of _physical_ and _logical_ devices. A
physical device usually represents a single device in a system (perhaps made
up of several individual hardware devices working together), of which there
are a finite number. A logical device represents an application's view of
the device.

[[devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration]]
== Physical Devices

To retrieve a list of physical device objects representing the
physical devices installed in the system, call:

include::../protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

  * pname:instance is a handle to a {apiname} instance previously created
    with fname:vkCreateInstance.
  * If pname:pPhysicalDevices is `NULL`, the number of physical devices
    available is returned in pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount. If
    pname:pPhysicalDevices is not `NULL`,
  * pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount must: point to a variable set by the user to
    the size of the array pointed to by pname:pPhysicalDevices, and is
    overwritten with the number of physical devices actually written to
    pname:pPhysicalDevices.

include::../validity/protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]

Once enumerated, general properties of the physical devices are queried by
calling:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pProperties points to an instance of the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure, that will be filled with
    returned information.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

The definition of sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties is:

include::../structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

The members of sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties have the following meanings:

  * pname:apiVersion is the version of {apiname} supported by the device,
    encoded as described in the <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version
    Numbers and Semantics>> section.
  * pname:driverVersion is the vendor-specified version of the driver.
  * pname:vendorID is a unique identifier for the _vendor_ (see below) of
    the physical device.
  * pname:deviceID is a unique identifier for the physical device among
    devices available from the vendor.
  * pname:deviceType is a elink:VkPhysicalDeviceType specifying the type of
    device.
  * pname:deviceName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string
    containing the name of the device.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE,
    containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier
    for the device.
  * pname:limits is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure which
    specifies device-specific limits of the physical device. See
    <<features-limits,Limits>> for details.
  * pname:sparseProperties is the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties
    structure which specifies various sparse related properties of the
    physical device. See <<features-sparseproperties,Sparse Properties>> for
    details.

include::../validity/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]

The pname:vendorID and pname:deviceID fields are provided to allow
applications to adapt to device characteristics that are not
adequately exposed by other Vulkan queries. These may include
performance profiles, hardware errata, or other characteristics.
In PCI-based implementations, the low sixteen bits of pname:vendorID
and pname:deviceID must: contain (respectively) the PCI vendor and
device IDs associated with the hardware device, and the remaining bits
must: be set to zero. In non-PCI implementations, the choice of what values
to return may: be dictated by operating system or platform policies. It is
otherwise at the discretion of the implementer, subject to the following
constraints and guidelines:

  * For purposes of physical device identification, the _vendor_ of a
    physical device is the entity responsible for the most salient
    characteristics of the hardware represented by the physical device
    handle. In the case of a discrete GPU, this should: be the GPU
    chipset vendor. In the case of a GPU or other accelerator integrated
    into a system-on-chip (SoC), this should: be the supplier of the
    silicon IP used to create the GPU or other accelerator.
  * If the vendor of the physical device has a valid PCI vendor ID issued by
    https://pcisig.com/[PCI-SIG], that ID should: be used to construct the
    value of pname:vendorID as described above for PCI-based
    implementations. Implementations that do not return a PCI vendor ID in
    pname:vendorID must: return a valid Khronos vendor ID, obtained as
    defined in the <<extensions-vendor-id,Registering a Vendor ID with
    Khronos>> section. Khronos vendor IDs are allocated starting at 0x10000,
    to distinguish them from the PCI vendor ID namespace.
  * The vendor of the physical device is responsible for selecting the
    value of pname:deviceID. The value selected should: uniquely
    identify both the device version and any major configuration options
    (for example, core count in the case of multicore devices). The same
    device ID should: be used for all physical implementations of that
    device version and configuration. For example, all uses of a
    specific silicon IP GPU version and configuration should use the
    same device ID, even if those uses occur in different SoCs.

The physical devices types are:

include::../enums/VkPhysicalDeviceType.txt[]

  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER The device does not match any
    other available types.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU The device is typically
    one embedded in or tightly coupled with the host.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU The device is typically
    a separate processor connected to the host via an interlink.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU The device is typically
    a virtual node in a virtualization environment.
  * ename:VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU The device is typically running on the
    same processors as the host.

The physical device type is advertised for informational purposes only, and
does not directly affect the operation of the system. However, the device
type may correlate with other advertised properties or capabilities of the
system, such as how many memory heaps there are.

Properties of queues available on a physical device are queried by calling:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to
    the number of queue families available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of sname:VkQueueFamilyProperties structures.

If pname:pQueueFamilyProperties is `NULL`, then the number of queue families
available is returned in pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount. Otherwise,
pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to
the number of elements in the pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually
written to pname:pQueueFamilyProperties. If the value of
pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount is less than the number of queue families
available, at most pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount structures will be
written.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.txt[]

The definition of sname:VkQueueFamilyProperties is:

include::../structs/VkQueueFamilyProperties.txt[]

The members of sname:VkQueueFamilyProperties have the following meanings:

  * pname:queueFlags contains flags indicating the capabilities of the
    queues in this queue family.
  * pname:queueCount is the unsigned integer count of queues in this
    queue family.
  * pname:timestampValidBits is the unsigned integer count of meaningful
    bits in the timestamps written via fname:vkCmdWriteTimestamp. The valid
    range for the count is 36..64 bits, or a value of 0, indicating no
    support for timestamps. Bits outside the valid range are guaranteed to
    be zeros.
  * pname:minImageTransferGranularity is the minimum granularity
    supported for image transfer operations on the queues in this queue
    family.

The bits specified in pname:queueFlags are:
include::../enums/VkQueueFlagBits.txt[]

  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support graphics operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support compute operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT is set, then the queues in this queue
    family support transfer operations.
  * if ename:VK_QUEUE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT is set, then the queues in this
    queue family support sparse memory management operations (see
    <<sparsememory,Sparse Resources>>). If any of the sparse resource
    features are enabled, then at least one queue family must: support this
    bit.

If an implementation exposes any queue family that supports graphics
operations, at least one queue family of at least one physical device
exposed by the implementation must: support both graphics and compute
operations.

include::../validity/structs/VkQueueFamilyProperties.txt[]

For further details see <<devsandqueues-queues,Queues>>.

The value returned in pname:minImageTransferGranularity has a unit of blocks
for images having a block compressed format, and a unit of texels otherwise.

Possible values of pname:minImageTransferGranularity are:

  * latexmath:[$(0,0,0)$] which indicates that only whole mip levels must:
    be transferred using the image transfer operations on the corresponding
    queues. In this case, the following restrictions apply to all offset and
    extent parameters of image transfer operations:

  ** The pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z members of a sname:VkOffset3D
     parameter must: always be zero.
  ** The pname:width, pname:height, and pname:depth members of a
     sname:VkExtent3D parameter must: always match the width, height, and
     depth of the image subresource corresponding to the parameter,
     respectively.

  * latexmath:[$(Ax, Ay, Az)$] where latexmath:[$Ax$], latexmath:[$Ay$],
    and latexmath:[$Az$] are all integer powers of two. In this case the
    following restrictions apply to all image transfer operations:

  ** pname:x, pname:y, and pname:z of a sname:VkOffset3D parameter must: be
     integer multiples of latexmath:[$Ax$], latexmath:[$Ay$], and
     latexmath:[$Az$], respectively.
  ** pname:width of a sname:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of latexmath:[$Ax$], or else latexmath:[$(x + width)$] must:
     equal the width of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** pname:height of a sname:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of latexmath:[$Ay$], or else latexmath:[$(y + height)$] must:
     equal the height of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** pname:depth of a sname:VkExtent3D parameter must: be an integer
     multiple of latexmath:[$Az$], or else latexmath:[$(z + depth)$] must:
     equal the depth of the image subresource corresponding to the
     parameter.
  ** If the format of the image corresponding to the parameters is one of
     the block compressed formats then for the purposes of the above
     calculations the granularity must: be scaled up by the block size.

Queues supporting graphics and/or compute operations must: report
latexmath:[$(1,1,1)$] in pname:minImageTransferGranularity, meaning that
there are no additional restrictions on the granularity of image
transfer operations for these queues. Other queues supporting image
transfer operations are only required: to support whole mip level
transfers, thus the value of pname:minImageTransferGranularity for
queues belonging to such queue families may: be latexmath:[$(0,0,0)$].

The <<memory-device,Device Memory>> section describes memory properties
queried from the physical device.

For physical device feature queries see the <<features, Features>> chapter.

[[devsandqueues-devices]]
== Devices

Device objects represent logical connections to physical devices. Each
device exposes a number of _queue families_ each having one or more
_queues_. All queues in a queue family support the same operations.

As described in <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Devices>>, a {apiname} application will first query for all physical devices
in a system. Each physical device can: then be queried for its capabilities,
including its queue and queue family properties. Once an acceptable physical
device is identified, an application will create a corresponding logical
device. An application must: create a separate logical device for each
physical device it will use. The created logical device is then the primary
interface to the physical device.

How to enumerate the physical devices in a system and query those physical
devices for their queue family properties is described in the
<<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration, Physical Device Enumeration>>
section above.


[[devsandqueues-device-creation]]
=== Device Creation

A logical device is created as a _connection_ to a physical device. To
create a logical device, call:

include::../protos/vkCreateDevice.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice must: be one of the device handles returned from a
    call to fname:vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices (see
    <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration, Physical Device
    Enumeration>>).
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure
    containing information about how to create the device.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pDevice points to a handle in which the created sname:VkDevice is
    returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateDevice.txt[]

The definition of sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo is:

include::../structs/VkDeviceCreateInfo.txt[]

The members of sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo have the following meanings:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:queueCreateInfoCount is the unsigned integer size of the
    pname:pQueueCreateInfos array. Refer to the
    <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below for
    further details.
  * pname:pQueueCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures describing the queues that are
    requested to be created along with the logical device. Refer to the
    <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below for
    further details.
  * pname:enabledLayerCount is the number of device layers to enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledLayerNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledLayerCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of layers to enable for the created device. See the
    <<querying-layers-and-extensions,Querying Layers and Extensions>>
    chapter for further details.
  * pname:enabledExtensionCount is the number of device extensions to
    enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledExtensionNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledExtensionCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of extensions to enable for the created device. See the
    <<querying-layers-and-extensions,Querying Layers and Extensions>>
    chapter for further details.
  * pname:pEnabledFeatures is a pointer to a sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    structure that contains boolean indicators of all the features to be
    enabled. Refer to the <<features-features,Features>> section for further
    details.

include::../validity/structs/VkDeviceCreateInfo.txt[]

Multiple logical devices can: be created from the same physical device.
Logical device creation may: fail due to lack of device-specific resources
(in addition to the other errors). If that occurs, fname:vkCreateDevice will
return ename:VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS.

[[devsandqueues-use]]
=== Device Use

The following is a high-level list of sname:VkDevice uses along with
references on where to find more information:

  * Creation of queues. See the <<devsandqueues-queues,Queues>> section
    below for further details.
  * Creation and tracking of various synchronization constructs. See
    <<synchronization,Synchronization and Cache Control>> for further
    details.
  * Allocating, freeing, and managing memory. See <<memory,Memory
    Allocation>> and <<resources,Resource Creation>> for further details.
  * Creation and destruction of command buffers and command buffer pools.
    See <<commandbuffers,Command Buffers>> for further details.
  * Creation, destruction, and management of graphics state. See
    <<pipelines,Pipelines>> and <<descriptorsets,Resource Descriptors>>,
    among others, for further details.


[[devsandqueues-idle]]
=== Device Idle

A device is active while any of its queues have work to process. Once all
device queues are idle, the device is idle. To wait for this condition,
call:

include::../protos/vkDeviceWaitIdle.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device to idle.

include::../validity/protos/vkDeviceWaitIdle.txt[]


[[devsandqueues-lost-device]]
=== Lost Device

A logical device may: become _lost_ because of hardware errors, execution
timeouts, power management events and/or platform-specific events. This may:
cause pending and future command execution to fail and cause hardware
resources to be corrupted. When this happens, certain commands will return
ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST (see <<fundamentals-errorcodes,Error Codes>> for
a list of such commands). After any such event, the logical device is
considered _lost_. It is not possible to reset the logical device to a
non-lost state, however the lost state is specific to a logical device
(sname:VkDevice), and the corresponding physical device
(sname:VkPhysicalDevice) may: be otherwise unaffected. In some cases, the
physical device may: also be lost, and attempting to create a new logical
device will fail, returning ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST. This is usually
indicative of a problem with the underlying hardware, or its connection to
the host. If the physical device has not been lost, and a new logical device
is successfully created from that physical device, it must: be in the
non-lost state.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Whilst logical device loss may: be recoverable, in the case of physical
device loss, it is unlikely that an application will be able to recover
unless additional, unaffected physical devices exist on the system. The
error is largely informational and intended only to inform the user that
their hardware has probably developed a fault or become physically
disconnected, and should: be investigated further. In many cases, physical
device loss may: cause other more serious issues such as the operating
system crashing; in which case it maynot: be reported via the {apiname} API.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Undefined behavior caused by an application error may: cause a device to
become lost. However, such undefined behavior may: also cause unrecoverable
damage to the process, and it is then not guaranteed that the API objects,
including the sname:VkPhysicalDevice or the sname:VkInstance are still valid
or that the error is recoverable.
====

When a device is lost, its child objects are not implicitly destroyed and
their handles are still valid. Those objects must: still be destroyed before
their parents or the device can: be destroyed (see
<<objectmodel-lifetime,Lifetime>>). The host address space corresponding to
device memory mapped using flink:vkMapMemory is still valid, and host memory
accesses to these mapped regions are still valid, but the contents are
undefined. It is still legal to call any API command on the device and child
objects.

Once a device is lost, command execution may: fail, and commands that return
a basetype:VkResult may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST. Commands that do
not allow run-time errors must: still operate correctly for valid usage and,
if applicable, return valid data.

Commands that wait indefinitely for device execution (namely
flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle, flink:vkQueueWaitIdle, flink:vkWaitForFences or
flink:vkAcquireNextImageKHR with a maximum pname:timeout, and
flink:vkGetQueryPoolResults with the ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT bit set
in pname:flags) must: return in finite time even in the case of a lost
device, and return either ename:VK_SUCCESS or ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
For any command that may: return ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST, for the purpose
of determining whether a command buffer is pending execution, or whether
resources are considered in-use by the device, a return value of
ename:VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST is equivalent to ename:VK_SUCCESS.

ifdef::editing-notes[]
[NOTE]
.editing-note
====
TODO (piman) - I don't think we're very clear about what ``in-use by the
device'' means.
====
endif::editing-notes[]


[[devsandqueues-destruction]]
=== Device Destruction

To destroy a device, call:

include::../protos/vkDestroyDevice.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

include::../validity/protos/vkDestroyDevice.txt[]

To ensure that no work is active on the device, flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle
can: be used to gate the destruction of the device. Prior to destroying a
device, an application is responsible for destroying/freeing any {apiname}
objects that were created using that device as the first parameter of the
corresponding ftext:vkCreate* or ftext:vkAllocate* command.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The lifetime of each of these objects is bound by the lifetime of the
sname:VkDevice object. Therefore, to avoid resource leaks, it is critical
that an application explicitly free all of these resources prior to calling
fname:vkDestroyDevice.
====


[[devsandqueues-queues]]
== Queues


[[devsandqueues-queueprops]]
=== Queue Family Properties

As discussed in the <<devsandqueues-physical-device-enumeration,Physical
Device Enumeration>> section above, the
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties command is used to retrieve
details about the queue families and queues supported by a device.

Each index in the pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties describes a unique queue
family on that physical device. These indices are used when creating queues,
and they correspond directly with the pname:queueFamilyIndex that is passed
to the flink:vkCreateDevice command via the slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo
structure as described in the <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue
Creation>> section below.

Grouping of queue families within a physical device is
implementation-dependent.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The general expectation is that a physical device groups all queues of
matching capabilities into a single family. However, this is a
recommendation to implementations and it is possible that a physical device
may: return two separate queue families with the same capabilities.
====

Once an application has identified a physical device with the queue(s) that
it desires to use, it will create those queues in conjunction with a logical
device. This is described in the following section.


[[devsandqueues-queue-creation]]
=== Queue Creation

Creating a logical device also creates the queues associated with that
device. The queues to create are described by a set of
sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures that are passed to
flink:vkCreateDevice in pname:pQueueCreateInfos. The definition of
sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo is:

include::../structs/VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo.txt[]

The members of sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo have the following meanings:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex is an unsigned integer indicating the index of
    the queue family to create on this device. The value of this index
    corresponds to the index of an element of the
    pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array that was returned by
    fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.
  * pname:queueCount is an unsigned integer specifying the number of
    queues to create in the queue family indicated by
    pname:queueFamilyIndex.
  * pname:pQueuePriorities is an array of pname:queueCount
    normalized floating point values, specifying priorities of work that
    will be submitted to each created queue. See
    <<devsandqueues-priority,Queue Priority>> for more information.

include::../validity/structs/VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo.txt[]

To retrieve a handle to a VkQueue object, call:

include::../protos/vkGetDeviceQueue.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the queue.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex is the index of the queue family to which the
    queue belongs.
  * pname:queueIndex is the index within this queue family of the queue to
    retrieve.
  * pname:pQueue is a pointer to a sname:VkQueue object that will be filled
    with the handle for the requested queue.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetDeviceQueue.txt[]


[[devsandqueues-index]]
=== Queue Family Index

The queue family index is used in multiple places in {apiname} in order to
tie operations to a specific family of queues.

When retrieving a handle to the queue via fname:vkGetDeviceQueue, the queue
family index is used to select which queue family to retrieve the
sname:VkQueue handle from as described in the previous section.

When creating a sname:VkCommandPool object (see
<<commandbuffers-pools,Command Pools>>), a queue family index is specified
in the sname:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure. Command buffers from this
pool can: only be submitted on queues corresponding to this queue family.

When creating sname:VkImage (see <<resources-images,Images>>) and
sname:VkBuffer (see <<resources-buffers,Buffers>>) resources, a set of queue
families is included in the slink:VkImageCreateInfo and
slink:VkBufferCreateInfo structures to specify the queue families that can:
access the resource.

When inserting a slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier or slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier
(see <<synchronization-events>>) a source and destination queue family index
is specified to allow the ownership of a buffer or image to be transferred
from one queue family to another. See the <<resources-sharing,Resource
Sharing>> section for details.


[[devsandqueues-priority]]
=== Queue Priority

Each queue is assigned a priority, as set in the
sname:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures when creating the device. The
priority of each queue is a normalized floating point value between 0.0 and
1.0, which is then translated to a discrete priority level by the
implementation. Higher values indicate a higher priority, with 0.0 being the
lowest priority and 1.0 being the highest.

Within the same device, queues with higher priority may: be allotted more
processing time than queues with lower priority. The implementation makes no
guarantees with regards to ordering or scheduling among queues with the same
priority, other than the constraints defined by explicit scheduling
primitives. The implementation make no guarantees with regards to queues
across different devices.

An implementation may: allow a higher-priority queue to starve a
lower-priority queue on the same sname:VkDevice until the higher-priority
queue has no further commands to execute. The relationship of queue
priorities mustnot: cause queues on one VkDevice to starve queues on another
sname:VkDevice.

No specific guarantees are made about higher priority queues receiving more
processing time or better quality of service than lower priority queues.


[[devsandqueues-queuesynchronization]]
=== Queue Synchronization

To wait on the completion of all work within a single queue, call:

include::../protos/vkQueueWaitIdle.txt[]

  * pname:queue is the queue on which to wait.

fname:vkQueueWaitIdle will block until all command buffers and sparse
binding operations in the queue have completed.

include::../validity/protos/vkQueueWaitIdle.txt[]

Synchronization between queues is done using {apiname} semaphores as
described in the <<synchronization,Synchronization and Cache Control>>
chapter.


[[devsandqueues-sparsebinding]]
=== Sparse Memory Binding

In {apiname} it is possible to sparsely bind memory to buffers and
images as described in the <<sparsemem,Sparse Resource>> chapter. Sparse
memory binding is a queue operation. A queue whose flags include the
ename:VK_QUEUE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT must: be able to support the
mapping of a virtual address to a physical address on the device. This
causes an update to the page table mappings on the device. This update must:
be synchronized on a queue to avoid corrupting page table mappings during
execution of graphics commands. By binding the sparse memory resources on
queues, all commands that are dependent on the updated bindings are
synchronized to only execute after the binding is updated. See the
<<synchronization,Synchronization and Cache Control>> chapter for how this
synchronization is accomplished.


[[devsandqueues-queuedestruction]]
=== Queue Destruction

Queues are created along with a logical device during
fname:vkCreateDevice. All queues associated with a logical device
are destroyed when fname:vkDestroyDevice is called on that device.
