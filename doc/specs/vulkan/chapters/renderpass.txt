[[renderpass]]
= Render Pass

// refBegin VkRenderPass Opaque handle to a render pass object

A _render pass_ represents a collection of attachments, subpasses, and
dependencies between the subpasses, and describes how the attachments are
used over the course of the subpasses.
The use of a render pass in a command buffer is a _render pass instance_.

Render passes are represented by sname:VkRenderPass handles:

include::../api/handles/VkRenderPass.txt[]

// refEnd VkRenderPass

An _attachment description_ describes the properties of an attachment
including its format, sample count, and how its contents are treated at the
beginning and end of each render pass instance.

[[renderpass-subpass]]
A _subpass_ represents a phase of rendering that reads and writes a subset
of the attachments in a render pass.
Rendering commands are recorded into a particular subpass of a render pass
instance.

A _subpass description_ describes the subset of attachments that is involved
in the execution of a subpass.
Each subpass can: read from some attachments as _input attachments_, write
to some as _color attachments_ or _depth/stencil attachments_, and perform
_multisample resolve operations_ to _resolve attachments_.
A subpass description can: also include a set of _preserve attachments_,
which are attachments that are not read or written by the subpass but whose
contents must: be preserved throughout the subpass.

A subpass _uses an attachment_ if the attachment is a color, depth/stencil,
resolve, or input attachment for that subpass (as determined by the
pname:pColorAttachments, pname:pDepthStencilAttachment,
pname:pResolveAttachments, and pname:pInputAttachments members of
slink:VkSubpassDescription, respectively).
A subpass does not use an attachment if that attachment is preserved by the
subpass.
The _first use of an attachment_ is in the lowest numbered subpass that uses
that attachment.
Similarly, the _last use of an attachment_ is in the highest numbered
subpass that uses that attachment.

The subpasses in a render pass all render to the same dimensions, and
fragments for pixel (x,y,layer) in one subpass can: only read attachment
contents written by previous subpasses at that same (x,y,layer) location.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
By describing a complete set of subpasses in advance, render passes provide
the implementation an opportunity to optimize the storage and transfer of
attachment data between subpasses.

In practice, this means that subpasses with a simple framebuffer-space
dependency may: be merged into a single tiled rendering pass, keeping the
attachment data on-chip for the duration of a render pass instance.
However, it is also quite common for a render pass to only contain a single
subpass.
====

_Subpass dependencies_ describe <<synchronization-dependencies, execution
and memory dependencies>> between subpasses.

A _subpass dependency chain_ is a sequence of subpass dependencies in a
render pass, where the source subpass of each subpass dependency (after the
first) equals the destination subpass of the previous dependency.

Execution of subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to
other subpasses, unless otherwise enforced by an execution dependency.
Each subpass only respects <<synchronization-submission-order, submission
order>> for commands recorded in the same subpass, and the
flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass and flink:vkCmdEndRenderPass commands that
delimit the render pass - commands within other subpasses are not included.
This affects most other <<synchronization-implicit, implicit ordering
guarantees>>.

A render pass describes the structure of subpasses and attachments
independent of any specific image views for the attachments.
The specific image views that will be used for the attachments, and their
dimensions, are specified in sname:VkFramebuffer objects.
Framebuffers are created with respect to a specific render pass that the
framebuffer is compatible with (see <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass
Compatibility>>).
Collectively, a render pass and a framebuffer define the complete render
target state for one or more subpasses as well as the algorithmic
dependencies between the subpasses.

The various pipeline stages of the drawing commands for a given subpass may:
execute concurrently and/or out of order, both within and across drawing
commands, whilst still respecting <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order,
pipeline order>>.
However for a given (x,y,layer,sample) sample location, certain per-sample
operations are performed in <<primrast-order,rasterization order>>.

    in each subpass, if desired.

[[renderpass-load-store-ops]]
If the attachment uses a color format, then pname:loadOp and pname:storeOp
are used, and pname:stencilLoadOp and pname:stencilStoreOp are ignored.
If the format has depth and/or stencil components, pname:loadOp and
pname:storeOp apply only to the depth data, while pname:stencilLoadOp and
pname:stencilStoreOp define how the stencil data is handled.
pname:loadOp and pname:stencilLoadOp define the _load operations_ that
execute as part of the first subpass that uses the attachment.
pname:storeOp and pname:stencilStoreOp define the _store operations_ that
execute as part of the last subpass that uses the attachment.

The load operation for each value in an attachment used by a subpass
happens-before any command recorded into that subpass reads from that value.
Load operations for attachments with a depth/stencil format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT pipeline stage.
Load operations for attachments with a color format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage.

Store operations for each value in an attachment used by a subpass
happen-after any command recorded into that subpass writes to that value.
Store operations for attachments with a depth/stencil format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT pipeline stage.
Store operations for attachments with a color format execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage.

If an attachment is not used by any subpass, then pname:loadOp,
pname:storeOp, pname:stencilStoreOp, and pname:stencilLoadOp are ignored,
and the attachment's memory contents will not be modified by execution of a
render pass instance.

[[renderpass-precision]]
During a render pass instance, input/color attachments with color formats
that have a component size of 8, 16, or 32 bits must: be represented in the
attachment's format throughout the instance.
Attachments with other floating- or fixed-point color formats, or with depth
components may: be represented in a format with a precision higher than the
attachment format, but must: be represented with the same range.
When such a component is loaded via the pname:loadOp, it will be converted
into an implementation-dependent format used by the render pass.
Such components must: be converted from the render pass format, to the
format of the attachment, before they are resolved or stored at the end of a
render pass instance via pname:storeOp.
Conversions occur as described in <<fundamentals-numerics,Numeric
Representation and Computation>> and <<fundamentals-fixedconv, Fixed-Point
Data Conversions>>.

[[renderpass-aliasing]]
If pname:flags includes ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT, then
the attachment is treated as if it shares physical memory with another
attachment in the same render pass.
This information limits the ability of the implementation to reorder certain
operations (like layout transitions and the pname:loadOp) such that it is
not improperly reordered against other uses of the same physical memory via
a different attachment.
This is described in more detail below.

  * pname:finalLayout must: not be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED

TODO (Jon) - the following text may need to be moved back to combine with
flink:vkCreateRenderPass above for automatic ref page generation.
====
endif::editing-notes[]

If a render pass uses multiple attachments that alias the same device
memory, those attachments must: each include the
ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT bit in their attachment
description flags.
Attachments aliasing the same memory occurs in multiple ways:

  * Multiple attachments being assigned the same image view as part of
    framebuffer creation.
  * Attachments using distinct image views that correspond to the same image
    subresource of an image.
  * Attachments using views of distinct image subresources which are bound
    to overlapping memory ranges.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Render passes must: include subpass dependencies (either directly or via a
subpass dependency chain) between any two subpasses that operate on the same
attachment or aliasing attachments and those subpass dependencies must:
include execution and memory dependencies separating uses of the aliases, if
at least one of those subpasses writes to one of the aliases.
These dependencies must: not include the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT
if the aliases are views of distinct image subresources which overlap in
memory.
====

Multiple attachments that alias the same memory must: not be used in a
single subpass.
A given attachment index must: not be used multiple times in a single
subpass, with one exception: two subpass attachments can: use the same
attachment index if at least one use is as an input attachment and neither
use is as a resolve or preserve attachment.
In other words, the same view can: be used simultaneously as an input and
color or depth/stencil attachment, but must: not be used as multiple color
or depth/stencil attachments nor as resolve or preserve attachments.
The precise set of valid scenarios is described in more detail
<<renderpass-feedbackloop, below>>.

If a set of attachments alias each other, then all except the first to be
used in the render pass must: use an pname:initialLayout of
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, since the earlier uses of the other aliases
make their contents undefined.
Once an alias has been used and a different alias has been used after it,
the first alias must: not be used in any later subpasses.
However, an application can: assign the same image view to multiple aliasing
attachment indices, which allows that image view to be used multiple times
even if other aliases are used in between.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Once an attachment needs the ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT
bit, there should: be no additional cost of introducing additional aliases,
and using these additional aliases may: allow more efficient clearing of the
attachments on multiple uses via ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR.

    Currently, only graphics subpasses are supported.
  * pname:inputAttachmentCount is the number of input attachments.
  * pname:pInputAttachments is an array of slink:VkAttachmentReference
    structures (defined below) that lists which of the render pass's
    attachments can: be read in the shader during the subpass, and what
    layout each attachment will be in during the subpass.
    Each element of the array corresponds to an input attachment unit number
    in the shader, i.e. if the shader declares an input variable
    `layout(input_attachment_index=X, set=Y, binding=Z)` then it uses the
    attachment provided in pname:pInputAttachments[X].
    Input attachments must: also be bound to the pipeline with a descriptor
    set, with the input attachment descriptor written in the location
    (set=Y, binding=Z).
  * pname:colorAttachmentCount is the number of color attachments.
  * pname:pColorAttachments is an array of pname:colorAttachmentCount
    slink:VkAttachmentReference structures that lists which of the render
    pass's attachments will be used as color attachments in the subpass, and
    what layout each attachment will be in during the subpass.
    Each element of the array corresponds to a fragment shader output
    location, i.e. if the shader declared an output variable
    `layout(location=X)` then it uses the attachment provided in
    pname:pColorAttachments[X].
  * pname:pResolveAttachments is `NULL` or an array of
    pname:colorAttachmentCount slink:VkAttachmentReference structures that
    lists which of the render pass's attachments are resolved to at the end
    of the subpass, and what layout each attachment will be in during the
    multisample resolve operation.
    If pname:pResolveAttachments is not `NULL`, each of its elements
    corresponds to a color attachment (the element in
    pname:pColorAttachments at the same index), and a multisample resolve
    operation is defined for each attachment.
    At the end of each subpass, multisample resolve operations read the
    subpass's color attachments, and resolve the samples for each pixel to
    the same pixel location in the corresponding resolve attachments, unless
    the resolve attachment index is ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.

  * The attachment is used as a color, depth/stencil, or resolve attachment
    in any subpass in the render pass.
  * There is a subpass *S~1~* that uses or preserves the attachment, and a
    subpass dependency from *S~1~* to *S*.
  * The attachment is not used or preserved in subpass *S*.

Once the contents of an attachment become undefined in subpass *S*, they
remain undefined for subpasses in subpass dependency chains starting with
subpass *S* until they are written again.
However, they remain valid for subpasses in other subpass dependency chains
starting with subpass *S~1~* if those subpasses use or preserve the
attachment.

The following two alleged implicit dependencies are practically no-ops, as
the operations they describe are already guaranteed by semaphores and
submission order (so they're almost entirely no-ops on their own).
The *only* reason they exist is because it simplifies reasoning about where
<<renderpass-layout-transitions, automatic layout transitions>> happen.
Further rewrites of this chapter could potentially remove the need for
these.

If there is no subpass dependency from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the
first subpass that uses an attachment, then an implicit subpass dependency
exists from ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL to the first subpass it is used in.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
----
VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL;
    .dstSubpass = firstSubpass; // First subpass attachment is used in
    .srcStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT;
    .dstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT;
    .srcAccessMask = 0;
    .dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT;
    .dependencyFlags = 0;
};
----

Similarly, if there is no subpass dependency from the last subpass that uses
an attachment to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, then an implicit subpass
dependency exists from the last subpass it is used in to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
----
VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = lastSubpass; // Last subpass attachment is used in
    .dstSubpass = VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL;
    .srcStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT;
    .dstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT;
    .srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
                     VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT;
    .dstAccessMask = 0;
    .dependencyFlags = 0;
};
----

[[renderpass-layout-transitions]]
As subpasses may: overlap or execute out of order with regards to other
subpasses unless a subpass dependency chain describes otherwise, the layout
transitions required between subpasses cannot: be known to an application.
Instead, an application provides the layout that each attachment must: be in
at the start and end of a renderpass, and the layout it must: be in during
each subpass it is used in.
The implementation then must: execute layout transitions between subpasses
in order to guarantee that the images are in the layouts required by each
subpass, and in the final layout at the end of the render pass.

Automatic layout transitions away from the layout used in a subpass
happen-after the availability operations for all dependencies with that
subpass as the pname:srcSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions into the layout used in a subpass happen-before
the visibility operations for all dependencies with that subpass as the
pname:dstSubpass.

Automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happens-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses the attachment
that will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions away from pname:initialLayout happen-after the
availability operations for all dependencies with a pname:srcSubpass equal
to ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:dstSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

Automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happens-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses the attachment that
will be transitioned.
For attachments created with ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT,
automatic layout transitions into pname:finalLayout happen-before the
visibility operations for all dependencies with a pname:dstSubpass equal to
ename:VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, where pname:srcSubpass uses any aliased
attachment.

If two subpasses use the same attachment in different layouts, and both
layouts are read-only, no subpass dependency needs to be specified between
those subpasses.
If an implementation treats those layouts separately, it must: insert an
implicit subpass dependency between those subpasses to separate the uses in
each layout.
The subpass dependency operates as if defined with the following parameters:

[source,c]
----
// Used for input attachments
VkPipelineStageFlags inputAttachmentStages = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT;
VkAccessFlags inputAttachmentAccess = VK_ACCESS_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT;

// Used for depth stencil attachments
VkPipelineStageFlags depthStencilAttachmentStages = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT | VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT;
VkAccessFlags depthStencilAttachmentAccess = VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT;

VkSubpassDependency implicitDependency = {
    .srcSubpass = firstSubpass;
    .dstSubpass = secondSubpass;
    .srcStageMask = inputAttachmentStages | depthStencilAttachmentStages;
    .dstStageMask = inputAttachmentStages | depthStencilAttachmentStages;
    .srcAccessMask = inputAttachmentAccess | depthStencilAttachmentAccess;
    .dstAccessMask = inputAttachmentAccess | depthStencilAttachmentAccess;
    .dependencyFlags = 0;
};
----

[[renderpass-feedbackloop]]
If a subpass uses the same attachment as both an input attachment and either
a color attachment or a depth/stencil attachment, writes via the color or
depth/stencil attachment are not automatically made visible to reads via the
input attachment, causing a _feedback loop_, except in any of the following
conditions:

  * If the color components or depth/stencil components read by the input
    attachment are mutually exclusive with the components written by the
    color or depth/stencil attachments, then there is no feedback loop.
    This requires the graphics pipelines used by the subpass to disable
    writes to color components that are read as inputs via the
    pname:colorWriteMask, and to disable writes to depth/stencil components
    that are read as inputs via pname:depthWriteEnable or
    pname:stencilTestEnable.
  * If the attachment is used as an input attachment and depth/stencil
    attachment only, and the depth/stencil attachment is not written to.
  * If a memory dependency is inserted between when the attachment is
    written and when it is subsequently read by later fragments.
    <<synchronization-pipeline-barriers, Pipeline barriers>> expressing a
    <<synchronization-pipeline-barriers-subpass-self-dependencies, subpass
    self-dependency>> are the only way to achieve this, and one must: be
    inserted every time a fragment will read values at a particular sample
    (x, y, layer, sample) coordinate, if those values have been written
    since the most recent pipeline barrier; or the since start of the
    subpass if there have been no pipeline barriers since the start of the
    subpass.

An attachment used as both an input attachment and a color attachment must:
be in the ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL layout.
An attachment used as an input attachment and depth/stencil attachment must:
be in either ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL or
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL.
An attachment must: not be used as both a depth/stencil attachment and a
color attachment.

[[renderpass-compatibility]]
== Render Pass Compatibility

Framebuffers and graphics pipelines are created based on a specific render
pass object.
They must: only be used with that render pass object, or one compatible with
it.

Two attachment references are compatible if they have matching format and
sample count, or are both ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED or the pointer that
would contain the reference is `NULL`.

Two arrays of attachment references are compatible if all corresponding
pairs of attachments are compatible.
If the arrays are of different lengths, attachment references not present in
the smaller array are treated as ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED.

Two render passes that contain only a single subpass are compatible if their
corresponding color, input, resolve, and depth/stencil attachment references
are compatible.

If two render passes contain more than one subpass, they are compatible if
they are identical except for:

  * Initial and final image layout in attachment descriptions
  * Load and store operations in attachment descriptions
  * Image layout in attachment references

A framebuffer is compatible with a render pass if it was created using the
same render pass or a compatible render pass.


== Framebuffers

// refBegin VkFramebuffer Opaque handle to a framebuffer object

Render passes operate in conjunction with _framebuffers_.
Framebuffers represent a collection of specific memory attachments that a
render pass instance uses.

Framebuffers are represented by sname:VkFramebuffer handles:

include::../api/handles/VkFramebuffer.txt[]

// refEnd VkFramebuffer

// refBegin vkCreateFramebuffer Create a new framebuffer object

To create a framebuffer, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateFramebuffer.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the framebuffer.
  * pname:pCreateInfo points to a slink:VkFramebufferCreateInfo structure
    which describes additional information about framebuffer creation.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pFramebuffer points to a sname:VkFramebuffer handle in which the
    resulting framebuffer object is returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateFramebuffer.txt[]

// refBegin VkFramebufferCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created framebuffer

The sname:VkFramebufferCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkFramebufferCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:renderPass is a render pass that defines what render passes the
    framebuffer will be compatible with.
    See <<renderpass-compatibility,Render Pass Compatibility>> for details.
  * pname:attachmentCount is the number of attachments.
  * pname:pAttachments is an array of sname:VkImageView handles, each of
    which will be used as the corresponding attachment in a render pass
    instance.
  * pname:width, pname:height and pname:layers define the dimensions of the
    framebuffer.

Image subresources used as attachments must: not be used via any
non-attachment usage for the duration of a render pass instance.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
This restriction means that the render pass has full knowledge of all uses
of all of the attachments, so that the implementation is able to make
correct decisions about when and how to perform layout transitions, when to
overlap execution of subpasses, etc.
====

[[renderpass-noattachments]]
It is legal for a subpass to use no color or depth/stencil attachments, and
rather use shader side effects such as image stores and atomics to produce
an output.
In this case, the subpass continues to use the pname:width, pname:height,
and pname:layers of the framebuffer to define the dimensions of the
rendering area, and the pname:rasterizationSamples from each pipeline's
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo to define the number of samples
used in rasterization; however, if
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures::pname:variableMultisampleRate is
code:VK_FALSE, then all pipelines to be bound with a given zero-attachment
subpass must: have the same value for
slink:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo::pname:rasterizationSamples.

****
  * pname:attachmentCount must: be equal to the attachment count specified
    in pname:renderPass

[[renderpass-commands]]
== Render Pass Commands

An application records the commands for a render pass instance one subpass
at a time, by beginning a render pass instance, iterating over the subpasses
to record commands for that subpass, and then ending the render pass
instance.

    structure (defined below) which indicates the render pass to begin an
    instance of, and the framebuffer the instance uses.
  * pname:contents specifies how the commands in the first subpass will be
    provided, and is one of the values:
+
--

  * pname:clearValueCount is the number of elements in pname:pClearValues.
  * pname:pClearValues is an array of slink:VkClearValue structures that
    contains clear values for each attachment, if the attachment uses a
    pname:loadOp value of ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR or if the
    attachment has a depth/stencil format and uses a pname:stencilLoadOp
    value of ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR.
    The array is indexed by attachment number.
    Only elements corresponding to cleared attachments are used.
    Other elements of pname:pClearValues are ignored.

pname:renderArea is the render area that is affected by the render pass
instance.
The effects of attachment load, store and multisample resolve operations are
restricted to the pixels whose x and y coordinates fall within the render

// refBegin vkCmdNextSubpass Transition to the next subpass of a render pass

To transition to the next subpass in the render pass instance after
recording the commands for a subpass, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdNextSubpass.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to record the
    command.
  * pname:contents specifies how the commands in the next subpass will be
    provided, in the same fashion as the corresponding parameter of
    flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass.

The subpass index for a render pass begins at zero when
fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass is recorded, and increments each time
fname:vkCmdNextSubpass is recorded.

Moving to the next subpass automatically performs any multisample resolve
operations in the subpass being ended.
End-of-subpass multisample resolves are treated as color attachment writes
for the purposes of synchronization.
That is, they are considered to execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage and their
writes are synchronized with ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT.
Synchronization between rendering within a subpass and any resolve
operations at the end of the subpass occurs automatically, without need for
explicit dependencies or pipeline barriers.
However, if the resolve attachment is also used in a different subpass, an
explicit dependency is needed.

After transitioning to the next subpass, the application can: record the
commands for that subpass.

.Valid Usage
****
  * The current subpass index must: be less than the number of subpasses in
    the render pass minus one
****

include::../validity/protos/vkCmdNextSubpass.txt[]

// refBegin vkCmdEndRenderPass End the current render pass

To record a command to end a render pass instance after recording the
commands for the last subpass, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdEndRenderPass.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to end the current
    render pass instance.

Ending a render pass instance performs any multisample resolve operations on
the final subpass.

.Valid Usage
****
  * The current subpass index must: be equal to the number of subpasses in
    the render pass minus one
