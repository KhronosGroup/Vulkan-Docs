[[descriptorsets]]
= Resource Descriptors

Shaders access buffer and image resources by using special shader variables
which are indirectly bound to buffer and image views via the API.
These variables are organized into sets, where each set of bindings is
represented by a _descriptor set_ object in the API and a descriptor set is
bound all at once.
A _descriptor_ is an opaque data structure representing a shader resource
such as a buffer view, image view, sampler, or combined image sampler.
The content of each set is determined by its _descriptor set layout_ and the
sequence of set layouts that can: be used by resource variables in shaders
within a pipeline is specified in a _pipeline layout_.

Each shader can: use up to pname:maxBoundDescriptorSets (see
<<features-limits, Limits>>) descriptor sets, and each descriptor set can:
include bindings for descriptors of all descriptor types.
Each shader resource variable is assigned a tuple of (set number, binding
number, array element) that defines its location within a descriptor set
layout.
In GLSL, the set number and binding number are assigned via layout
qualifiers, and the array element is implicitly assigned consecutively
starting with index equal to zero for the first element of an array (and
array element is zero for non-array variables):

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
// Assign set number = M, binding number = N, array element = 0
layout (set=M, binding=N) uniform sampler2D variableName;

// Assign set number = M, binding number = N for all array elements, and
// array element = I for the I'th member of the array.
layout (set=M, binding=N) uniform sampler2D variableNameArray[I];
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
// Assign set number = M, binding number = N, array element = 0
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %10 "variableName"
               OpDecorate %10 DescriptorSet M
               OpDecorate %10 Binding N
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 2D 0 0 0 1 Unknown
          %8 = OpTypeSampledImage %7
          %9 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %8
         %10 = OpVariable %9 UniformConstant
               ...

// Assign set number = M, binding number = N for all array elements, and
// array element = I for the I'th member of the array.
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %13 "variableNameArray"
               OpDecorate %13 DescriptorSet M
               OpDecorate %13 Binding N
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32

[[descriptorsets-types]]
== Descriptor Types

The following sections outline the various descriptor types supported by
Vulkan.
Each section defines a descriptor type, and each descriptor type has a
manifestation in the shading language and SPIR-V as well as in descriptor
sets.
There is mostly a one-to-one correspondence between descriptor types and
classes of opaque types in the shading language, where the opaque types in
the shading language must: refer to a descriptor in the pipeline layout of
the corresponding descriptor type.
But there is an exception to this rule as described in
<<descriptorsets-combinedimagesampler,Combined Image Sampler>>.


[[descriptorsets-storageimage]]
=== Storage Image

A _storage image_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE) is a descriptor
type that is used for load, store, and atomic operations on image memory
from within shaders bound to pipelines.

Loads from storage images do not use samplers and are unfiltered and do not
support coordinate wrapping or clamping.
Loads are supported in all shader stages for image formats which report
support for the
<<features-formats-properties,ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT>>
feature bit via flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties.

Stores to storage images are supported in compute shaders for image formats
which report support for the ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT
feature.

Storage images also support atomic operations in compute shaders for image
formats which report support for the
<<features-formats-properties,ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_ATOMIC_BIT>>
feature.

Load and store operations on storage images can: only be done on images in
the ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL layout.

When the <<features-features-fragmentStoresAndAtomics,
pname:fragmentStoresAndAtomics>> feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported for storage images in fragment shaders with
the same set of image formats as supported in compute shaders.
When the <<features-features-vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics,
pname:vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics>> feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported in vertex, tessellation, and geometry shaders
with the same set of image formats as supported in compute shaders.

Storage image declarations must: specify the image format in the shader if
the variable is used for atomic operations.

If the <<features-features-shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat,
pname:shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat>> feature is not enabled, storage
image declarations must: specify the image format in the shader if the
variable is used for load operations.

If the <<features-features-shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat,
pname:shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat>> feature is not enabled, storage
image declarations must: specify the image format in the shader if the
variable is used for store operations.

Storage images are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform code:image
variables of the appropriate dimensionality as well as a format layout
qualifier (if necessary):

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n, r32f) uniform image2D myStorageImage;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %9 "myStorageImage"
               OpDecorate %9 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %9 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 2D 0 0 0 2 R32f
          %8 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %7
          %9 = OpVariable %8 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-sampler]]
=== Sampler
A _sampler_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER) represents a set of
parameters which control address calculations, filtering behavior, and other
properties, that can: be used to perform filtered loads from _sampled
images_ (see <<descriptorsets-sampledimage, Sampled Image>>).

Samplers are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform code:sampler
variables, where the sampler type has no associated texture dimensionality:

.GLSL Example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) uniform sampler mySampler;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %8 "mySampler"
               OpDecorate %8 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %8 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeSampler
          %7 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %6
          %8 = OpVariable %7 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-sampledimage]]
=== Sampled Image

A _sampled image_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE) can: be used
(usually in conjunction with a sampler) to retrieve sampled image data.
Shaders use a sampled image handle and a sampler handle to sample data,
where the image handle generally defines the shape and format of the memory
and the sampler generally defines how coordinate addressing is performed.
The same sampler can: be used to sample from multiple images, and it is
possible to sample from the same sampled image with multiple samplers, each
containing a different set of sampling parameters.

Sampled images are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform code:texture
variables of the appropriate dimensionality:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) uniform texture2D mySampledImage;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %9 "mySampledImage"
               OpDecorate %9 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %9 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 2D 0 0 0 1 Unknown
          %8 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %7
          %9 = OpVariable %8 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-combinedimagesampler]]
=== Combined Image Sampler

A _combined image sampler_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER)
represents a sampled image along with a set of sampling parameters.
It is logically considered a sampled image and a sampler bound together.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
On some implementations, it may: be more efficient to sample from an image
using a combination of sampler and sampled image that are stored together in
the descriptor set in a combined descriptor.
====

Combined image samplers are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform
code:sampler variables of the appropriate dimensionality:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) uniform sampler2D myCombinedImageSampler;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %10 "myCombinedImageSampler"
               OpDecorate %10 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %10 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 2D 0 0 0 1 Unknown
          %8 = OpTypeSampledImage %7
          %9 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %8
         %10 = OpVariable %9 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------

ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER descriptor set entries can:
also be accessed via separate sampler and sampled image shader variables.
Such variables refer exclusively to the corresponding half of the
descriptor, and can: be combined in the shader with samplers or sampled
images that can: come from the same descriptor or from other combined or
separate descriptor types.
There are no additional restrictions on how a separate sampler or sampled
image variable is used due to it originating from a combined descriptor.


[[descriptorsets-uniformtexelbuffer]]
=== Uniform Texel Buffer

A _uniform texel buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER)
represents a tightly packed array of homogeneous formatted data that is
stored in a buffer and is made accessible to shaders.
Uniform texel buffers are read-only.

Uniform texel buffers are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform
code:samplerBuffer variables:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) uniform samplerBuffer myUniformTexelBuffer;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %10 "myUniformTexelBuffer"
               OpDecorate %10 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %10 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 Buffer 0 0 0 1 Unknown
          %8 = OpTypeSampledImage %7
          %9 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %8
         %10 = OpVariable %9 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-storagetexelbuffer]]
=== Storage Texel Buffer

A _storage texel buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER)
represents a tightly packed array of homogeneous formatted data that is
stored in a buffer and is made accessible to shaders.
Storage texel buffers differ from uniform texel buffers in that they support
stores and atomic operations in shaders, may: support a different maximum
length, and may: have different performance characteristics.

Storage texel buffers are declared in GLSL shader source using uniform
code:imageBuffer variables:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n, r32f) uniform imageBuffer myStorageTexelBuffer;
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"

               OpName %9 "myStorageTexelBuffer"
               OpDecorate %9 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %9 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeImage %6 Buffer 0 0 0 2 R32f
          %8 = OpTypePointer UniformConstant %7
          %9 = OpVariable %8 UniformConstant
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-uniformbuffer]]
=== Uniform Buffer

A _uniform buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER) is a region of
structured storage that is made accessible for read-only access to shaders.
It is typically used to store medium sized arrays of constants such as
shader parameters, matrices and other related data.

Uniform buffers are declared in GLSL shader source using the uniform storage
qualifier and block syntax:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) uniform myUniformBuffer
{
    vec4 myElement[32];
};
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"

               OpName %11 "myUniformBuffer"
               OpMemberName %11 0 "myElement"
               OpName %13 ""
               OpDecorate %10 ArrayStride 16
               OpMemberDecorate %11 0 Offset 0
               OpDecorate %11 Block
               OpDecorate %13 DescriptorSet m
               OpDecorate %13 Binding n
          %2 = OpTypeVoid
          %3 = OpTypeFunction %2
          %6 = OpTypeFloat 32
          %7 = OpTypeVector %6 4
          %8 = OpTypeInt 32 0
          %9 = OpConstant %8 32
         %10 = OpTypeArray %7 %9
         %11 = OpTypeStruct %10
         %12 = OpTypePointer Uniform %11
         %13 = OpVariable %12 Uniform
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-storagebuffer]]
=== Storage Buffer

A _storage buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER) is a region of
structured storage that supports both read and write access for shaders.
In addition to general read and write operations, some members of storage
buffers can: be used as the target of atomic operations.
In general, atomic operations are only supported on members that have
unsigned integer formats.

Storage buffers are declared in GLSL shader source using buffer storage
qualifier and block syntax:

.GLSL example
[source,glsl]
---------------------------------------------------
layout (set=m, binding=n) buffer myStorageBuffer
{
    vec4 myElement[];
};
---------------------------------------------------

.SPIR-V example
[source,spirv]
---------------------------------------------------
               ...
          %1 = OpExtInstImport "GLSL.std.450"
               ...
               OpName %9 "myStorageBuffer"
               OpMemberName %9 0 "myElement"
               OpName %11 ""
               OpDecorate %8 ArrayStride 16

         %11 = OpVariable %10 Uniform
               ...
---------------------------------------------------


[[descriptorsets-uniformbufferdynamic]]
=== Dynamic Uniform Buffer

A _dynamic uniform buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC)
differs from a uniform buffer only in how its address and length are
specified.
Uniform buffers bind a buffer address and length that is specified in the
descriptor set update by a buffer handle, offset and range (see
<<descriptorsets-updates, Descriptor Set Updates>>).
With dynamic uniform buffers the buffer handle, offset and range specified
in the descriptor set define the base address and length.
The dynamic offset which is relative to this base address is taken from the
pname:pDynamicOffsets parameter to flink:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets (see
<<descriptorsets-binding, Descriptor Set Binding>>).
The address used for a dynamic uniform buffer is the sum of the buffer base
address and the relative offset.
The length is unmodified and remains the range as specified in the
descriptor update.
The shader syntax is identical for uniform buffers and dynamic uniform
buffers.


[[descriptorsets-storagebufferdynamic]]
=== Dynamic Storage Buffer

A _dynamic storage buffer_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC)
differs from a storage buffer only in how its address and length are
specified.
The difference is identical to the difference between uniform buffers and
dynamic uniform buffers (see <<descriptorsets-uniformbufferdynamic, Dynamic
Uniform Buffer>>).
The shader syntax is identical for storage buffers and dynamic storage
buffers.


[[descriptorsets-inputattachment]]
=== Input Attachment

An _input attachment_ (ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT) is an
image view that can: be used for pixel local load operations from within
fragment shaders bound to pipelines.
Loads from input attachments are unfiltered.
All image formats that are supported for color attachments
(ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT) or depth/stencil attachments
(ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT) for a given image
tiling mode are also supported for input attachments.

In the shader, input attachments must: be decorated with their input
attachment index in addition to descriptor set and binding numbers.

---------------------------------------------------
layout (input_attachment_index=i, set=m, binding=n) uniform subpassInput myInputAttachment;

[[descriptorsets-sets]]
== Descriptor Sets

Descriptors are grouped together into descriptor set objects.
A descriptor set object is an opaque object that contains storage for a set
of descriptors, where the types and number of descriptors is defined by a
descriptor set layout.
The layout object may: be used to define the association of each descriptor
binding with memory or other hardware resources.
The layout is used both for determining the resources that need to be
associated with the descriptor set, and determining the interface between
shader stages and shader resources.


[[descriptorsets-setlayout]]
=== Descriptor Set Layout

// refBegin VkDescriptorSetLayout Opaque handle to a descriptor set layout object

A descriptor set layout object is defined by an array of zero or more
descriptor bindings.
Each individual descriptor binding is specified by a descriptor type, a
count (array size) of the number of descriptors in the binding, a set of
shader stages that can: access the binding, and (if using immutable
samplers) an array of sampler descriptors.

Descriptor set layout objects are represented by sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout
handles:

include::../api/handles/VkDescriptorSetLayout.txt[]

// refEnd VkDescriptorSetLayout

// refBegin vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout Create a new descriptor set layout

To create descriptor set layout objects, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the descriptor set
    layout.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo structure specifying the state of
    the descriptor set layout object.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pSetLayout points to a sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout handle in which
    the resulting descriptor set layout object is returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout.txt[]

// refBegin VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created descriptor set layout

Information about the descriptor set layout is passed in an instance of the
sname:VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo structure:

include::../api/structs/VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags provides options for descriptor set layout creation, and is
    of type elink:VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlags.
    Bits which can: be set include:

  * pname:bindingCount is the number of elements in pname:pBindings.
  * pname:pBindings is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding structures.

    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC
  * If pname:flags contains

// refBegin VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding Structure specifying a descriptor set layout binding

The sname:VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding.txt[]

  * pname:binding is the binding number of this entry and corresponds to a
    resource of the same binding number in the shader stages.
  * pname:descriptorType is a elink:VkDescriptorType specifying which type
    of resource descriptors are used for this binding.
  * pname:descriptorCount is the number of descriptors contained in the
    binding, accessed in a shader as an array.
    If pname:descriptorCount is zero this binding entry is reserved and the
    resource must: not be accessed from any stage via this binding within
    any pipeline using the set layout.
  * pname:stageFlags member is a bitmask of elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits
    specifying which pipeline shader stages can: access a resource for this
    binding.
    ename:VK_SHADER_STAGE_ALL is a shorthand specifying that all defined
    shader stages, including any additional stages defined by extensions,
    can: access the resource.
+
--
If a shader stage is not included in pname:stageFlags, then a resource must:
not be accessed from that stage via this binding within any pipeline using
the set layout.
There are no limitations on what combinations of stages can: be used by a
descriptor binding, and in particular a binding can: be used by both
graphics stages and the compute stage.
--
  * pname:pImmutableSamplers affects initialization of samplers.
    If pname:descriptorType specifies a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER or
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER type descriptor, then
    pname:pImmutableSamplers can: be used to initialize a set of _immutable
    samplers_.
    Immutable samplers are permanently bound into the set layout; later
    binding a sampler into an immutable sampler slot in a descriptor set is
    not allowed.
    If pname:pImmutableSamplers is not `NULL`, then it is considered to be a
    pointer to an array of sampler handles that will be consumed by the set
    layout and used for the corresponding binding.
    If pname:pImmutableSamplers is `NULL`, then the sampler slots are
    dynamic and sampler handles must: be bound into descriptor sets using
    this layout.
    If pname:descriptorType is not one of these descriptor types, then
    pname:pImmutableSamplers is ignored.

The above layout definition allows the descriptor bindings to be specified
sparsely such that not all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum binding
number need to be specified in the pname:pBindings array.
Bindings that are not specified have a pname:descriptorCount and
pname:stageFlags of zero, and the pname:descriptorType is treated as
undefined.
However, all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum binding number in the
slink:VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo::pname:pBindings array may: consume
memory in the descriptor set layout even if not all descriptor bindings are
used, though it should: not consume additional memory from the descriptor
pool.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The maximum binding number specified should: be as compact as possible to
avoid wasted memory.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * If pname:descriptorType is ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER or
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, and
    pname:descriptorCount is not `0` and pname:pImmutableSamplers is not
    `NULL`, pname:pImmutableSamplers must: be a pointer to an array of
    pname:descriptorCount valid sname:VkSampler handles
  * If pname:descriptorCount is not `0`, pname:stageFlags must: be a valid
    combination of elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits values

=== Pipeline Layouts

// refBegin VkPipelineLayout Opaque handle to a pipeline layout object

Access to descriptor sets from a pipeline is accomplished through a
_pipeline layout_.
Zero or more descriptor set layouts and zero or more push constant ranges
are combined to form a pipeline layout object which describes the complete
set of resources that can: be accessed by a pipeline.
The pipeline layout represents a sequence of descriptor sets with each
having a specific layout.
This sequence of layouts is used to determine the interface between shader
stages and shader resources.
Each pipeline is created using a pipeline layout.

Pipeline layout objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineLayout handles:

include::../api/handles/VkPipelineLayout.txt[]

// refEnd VkPipelineLayout

    sname:VkPushConstantRange structures defining a set of push constant
    ranges for use in a single pipeline layout.
    In addition to descriptor set layouts, a pipeline layout also describes
    how many push constants can: be accessed by each stage of the pipeline.

Once created, pipeline layouts are used as part of pipeline creation (see
<<pipelines, Pipelines>>), as part of binding descriptor sets (see
<<descriptorsets-binding, Descriptor Set Binding>>), and as part of setting
push constants (see <<descriptorsets-push-constants, Push Constant
Updates>>).
Pipeline creation accepts a pipeline layout as input, and the layout may: be
used to map (set, binding, arrayElement) tuples to hardware resources or
memory locations within a descriptor set.
The assignment of hardware resources depends only on the bindings defined in
the descriptor sets that comprise the pipeline layout, and not on any shader
source.

[[descriptorsets-pipelinelayout-consistency]]
All resource variables <<shaders-staticuse,statically used>> in all shaders
in a pipeline must: be declared with a (set,binding,arrayElement) that
exists in the corresponding descriptor set layout and is of an appropriate
descriptor type and includes the set of shader stages it is used by in
pname:stageFlags.
The pipeline layout can: include entries that are not used by a particular
pipeline, or that are dead-code eliminated from any of the shaders.
The pipeline layout allows the application to provide a consistent set of
bindings across multiple pipeline compiles, which enables those pipelines to
be compiled in a way that the implementation may: cheaply switch pipelines
without reprogramming the bindings.

Similarly, the push constant block declared in each shader (if present)
must: only place variables at offsets that are each included in a push
constant range with pname:stageFlags including the bit corresponding to the
shader stage that uses it.
The pipeline layout can: include ranges or portions of ranges that are not
used by a particular pipeline, or for which the variables have been
dead-code eliminated from any of the shaders.

There is a limit on the total number of resources of each type that can: be
included in bindings in all descriptor set layouts in a pipeline layout as
shown in <<descriptorsets-pipelinelayout-limits,Pipeline Layout Resource
Limits>>.
The "`Total Resources Available`" column gives the limit on the number of
each type of resource that can: be included in bindings in all descriptor
sets in the pipeline layout.
Some resource types count against multiple limits.
Additionally, there are limits on the total number of each type of resource
that can: be used in any pipeline stage as described in
<<interfaces-resources-limits,Shader Resource Limits>>.

[[descriptorsets-compatibility]]
==== Pipeline Layout Compatibility

Two pipeline layouts are defined to be "`compatible for
<<descriptorsets-push-constants, push constants>>`" if they were created
with identical push constant ranges.
Two pipeline layouts are defined to be "`compatible for set N`" if they were
created with _identically defined_ descriptor set layouts for sets zero
through N, and if they were created with identical push constant ranges.

When binding a descriptor set (see <<descriptorsets-binding, Descriptor Set
Binding>>) to set number N, if the previously bound descriptor sets for sets
zero through N-1 were all bound using compatible pipeline layouts, then
performing this binding does not disturb any of the lower numbered sets.
If, additionally, the previous bound descriptor set for set N was bound
using a pipeline layout compatible for set N, then the bindings in sets
numbered greater than N are also not disturbed.

Similarly, when binding a pipeline, the pipeline can: correctly access any
previously bound descriptor sets which were bound with compatible pipeline
layouts, as long as all lower numbered sets were also bound with compatible
layouts.

Layout compatibility means that descriptor sets can: be bound to a command
buffer for use by any pipeline created with a compatible pipeline layout,
and without having bound a particular pipeline first.
It also means that descriptor sets can: remain valid across a pipeline
change, and the same resources will be accessible to the newly bound
pipeline.

ifdef::implementation-guide[]
.Implementor's Note
****
A consequence of layout compatibility is that when the implementation
compiles a pipeline layout and assigns hardware units to resources, the
mechanism to assign hardware units for set N should: only be a function of
sets [0..N].
****
endif::implementation-guide[]

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Place the least frequently changing descriptor sets near the start of the
pipeline layout, and place the descriptor sets representing the most
frequently changing resources near the end.
When pipelines are switched, only the descriptor set bindings that have been
invalidated will need to be updated and the remainder of the descriptor set
bindings will remain in place.
====

The maximum number of descriptor sets that can: be bound to a pipeline
layout is queried from physical device properties (see
pname:maxBoundDescriptorSets in <<features-limits, Limits>>).

cause allocation failure, as described below.

created or most recently reset then fragmentation must: not cause an
allocation failure (note that this is always the case for a pool created
without the ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_FREE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_BIT bit
set).
Additionally, if all sets allocated from the pool since it was created or
most recently reset use the same number of descriptors (of each type) and
the requested allocation also uses that same number of descriptors (of each
type), then fragmentation must: not cause an allocation failure.

If an allocation failure occurs due to fragmentation, an application can:
create an additional descriptor pool to perform further descriptor set
allocations.

=== Descriptor Set Updates with Templates

// refBegin vkCreateDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR Create a new descriptor update template

Updating a large sname:VkDescriptorSet array can: be an expensive operation
since an application must: specify one slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet structure
for each descriptor or descriptor array to update, each of which
re-specifies the same state when updating the same descriptor in multiple
descriptor sets.
For cases when an application wishes to update the same set of descriptors
in multiple descriptor sets allocated using the same
sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout, flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR can:
be used as a replacement for flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSets.

sname:VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR allows implementations to convert a set
of descriptor update operations on a single descriptor set to an internal
format that, in conjunction with flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR
ifdef::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
or flink:vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR
endif::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
, can: be more efficient compared to calling flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSets
ifdef::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
or flink:vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR
endif::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
.
The descriptors themselves are not specified in the
sname:VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR, rather, offsets into an application
provided pointer to host memory are specified, which are combined with a
pointer passed to flink:vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR
ifdef::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
or flink:vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR
endif::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
.
This allows large batches of updates to be executed without having to
convert application data structures into a strictly-defined Vulkan data
structure.

include::../api/protos/vkCreateDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the descriptor update
    template.

=== Descriptor Set Binding

// refBegin vkCmdBindDescriptorSets Binds descriptor sets to a command buffer

To bind one or more descriptor sets to a command buffer, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdBindDescriptorSets.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer that the descriptor sets will
    be bound to.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint is a elink:VkPipelineBindPoint indicating
    whether the descriptors will be used by graphics pipelines or compute
    pipelines.
    There is a separate set of bind points for each of graphics and compute,
    so binding one does not disturb the other.
  * pname:layout is a sname:VkPipelineLayout object used to program the
    bindings.
  * pname:firstSet is the set number of the first descriptor set to be
    bound.
  * pname:descriptorSetCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDescriptorSets array.
  * pname:pDescriptorSets is an array of handles to sname:VkDescriptorSet
    objects describing the descriptor sets to write to.
  * pname:dynamicOffsetCount is the number of dynamic offsets in the
    pname:pDynamicOffsets array.
  * pname:pDynamicOffsets is a pointer to an array of code:uint32_t values
    specifying dynamic offsets.

fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets causes the sets numbered [pname:firstSet..
pname:firstSet+pname:descriptorSetCount-1] to use the bindings stored in
pname:pDescriptorSets[0..pname:descriptorSetCount-1] for subsequent
rendering commands (either compute or graphics, according to the
pname:pipelineBindPoint).
Any bindings that were previously applied via these sets are no longer
valid.

Once bound, a descriptor set affects rendering of subsequent graphics or
compute commands in the command buffer until a different set is bound to the
same set number, or else until the set is disturbed as described in
<<descriptorsets-compatibility, Pipeline Layout Compatibility>>.

A compatible descriptor set must: be bound for all set numbers that any
shaders in a pipeline access, at the time that a draw or dispatch command is
recorded to execute using that pipeline.
However, if none of the shaders in a pipeline statically use any bindings
with a particular set number, then no descriptor set need be bound for that
set number, even if the pipeline layout includes a non-trivial descriptor
set layout for that set number.

If any of the sets being bound include dynamic uniform or storage buffers,
then pname:pDynamicOffsets includes one element for each array element in
each dynamic descriptor type binding in each set.
Values are taken from pname:pDynamicOffsets in an order such that all
entries for set N come before set N+1; within a set, entries are ordered by
the binding numbers in the descriptor set layouts; and within a binding
array, elements are in order.
pname:dynamicOffsetCount must: equal the total number of dynamic descriptors
in the sets being bound.

The effective offset used for dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is
the sum of the relative offset taken from pname:pDynamicOffsets, and the
base address of the buffer plus base offset in the descriptor set.
The length of the dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is the buffer
range as specified in the descriptor set.

Each of the pname:pDescriptorSets must: be compatible with the pipeline
layout specified by pname:layout.
The layout used to program the bindings must: also be compatible with the
pipeline used in subsequent graphics or compute commands, as defined in the
<<descriptorsets-compatibility, Pipeline Layout Compatibility>> section.

The descriptor set contents bound by a call to fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets
may: be consumed during host execution of the command, or during shader
execution of the resulting draws, or any time in between.
Thus, the contents must: not be altered (overwritten by an update command,
or freed) between when the command is recorded and when the command
completes executing on the queue.
The contents of pname:pDynamicOffsets are consumed immediately during
execution of fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets.
Once all pending uses have completed, it is legal to update and reuse a
descriptor set.

.Valid Usage
****
  * Any given element of pname:pDescriptorSets must: have been allocated
    with a sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout that matches (is the same as, or
    identically defined as) the sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout at set _n_ in
    pname:layout, where _n_ is the sum of pname:firstSet and the index into
    pname:pDescriptorSets
  * pname:dynamicOffsetCount must: be equal to the total number of dynamic
    descriptors in pname:pDescriptorSets
  * The sum of pname:firstSet and pname:descriptorSetCount must: be less
    than or equal to sname:VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo::pname:setLayoutCount
    provided when pname:layout was created
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint must: be supported by the pname:commandBuffer's
    parent sname:VkCommandPool's queue family
  * Any given element of pname:pDynamicOffsets must: satisfy the required
    alignment for the corresponding descriptor binding's descriptor type

ifdef::VK_KHR_push_descriptor[]
[[descriptorsets-push-descriptors]]
=== Push Descriptor Updates

// refBegin vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR Pushes descriptor updates into a command buffer

In addition to allocating descriptor sets and binding them to a command
buffer, an application can: record descriptor updates into the command
buffer.

To push descriptor updates into a command buffer, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer that the descriptors will be
    recorded in.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint is a elink:VkPipelineBindPoint indicating
    whether the descriptors will be used by graphics pipelines or compute
    pipelines.
    There is a separate set of push descriptor bindings for each of graphics
    and compute, so binding one does not disturb the other.
  * pname:layout is a sname:VkPipelineLayout object used to program the
    bindings.
  * pname:set is the set number of the descriptor set in the pipeline layout
    that will be updated.
  * pname:descriptorWriteCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDescriptorWrites array.
  * pname:pDescriptorWrites is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet structures describing the descriptors to be
    updated.

_Push descriptors_ are a small bank of descriptors whose storage is
internally managed by the command buffer rather than being written into a
descriptor set and later bound to a command buffer.
Push descriptors allow for incremental updates of descriptors without
managing the lifetime of descriptor sets.

When a command buffer begins recording, all push descriptors have undefined
contents.
Push descriptors can: be updated incrementally and cause shaders to use the
updated descriptors for subsequent rendering commands (either compute or
graphics, according to the pname:pipelineBindPoint) until the descriptor is
overwritten, or else until the set is disturbed as described in
<<descriptorsets-compatibility, Pipeline Layout Compatibility>>.
When the set is disturbed or push descriptors with a different descriptor
set layout are set, all push descriptors become invalid.

Valid descriptors must: be pushed for all bindings that any shaders in a
pipeline access, at the time that a draw or dispatch command is recorded to
execute using that pipeline.
This includes immutable sampler descriptors, which must: be pushed before
they are accessed by a pipeline.
However, if none of the shaders in a pipeline statically use certain
bindings in the push descriptor set, then those descriptors need not be
valid.

Push descriptors do not use dynamic offsets.
Instead, the corresponding non-dynamic descriptor types can: be used and the
pname:offset member of slink:VkDescriptorBufferInfo can: be changed each
time the descriptor is written.

Each element of pname:pDescriptorWrites is interpreted as in
slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet, except the pname:dstSet member is ignored.

To push an immutable sampler, use a slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet with
pname:dstBinding and pname:dstArrayElement selecting the immutable sampler's
binding.
If the descriptor type is ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER, the
pname:pImageInfo parameter is ignored and the immutable sampler is taken
from the push descriptor set layout in the pipeline layout.
If the descriptor type is ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER,
the pname:sampler member of the the pname:pImageInfo parameter is ignored
and the immutable sampler is taken from the push descriptor set layout in
the pipeline layout.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint must: be supported by the pname:commandBuffer's
    parent sname:VkCommandPool's queue family
  * pname:set must: be less than
    sname:VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo::pname:setLayoutCount provided when
    pname:layout was created
  * pname:set must: be the unique set number in the pipeline layout that
    uses a descriptor set layout that was created with

=== Push Constant Updates

[[descriptorsets-push-constants]]

As described above in section <<descriptorsets-pipelinelayout, Pipeline
Layouts>>, the pipeline layout defines shader push constants which are
updated via Vulkan commands rather than via writes to memory or copy
commands.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Push constants represent a high speed path to modify constant data in
pipelines that is expected to outperform memory-backed resource updates.
====

The values of push constants are undefined at the start of a command buffer.

// refBegin vkCmdPushConstants Update the values of push constants

To update push constants, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdPushConstants.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which the push constant
    update will be recorded.
  * pname:layout is the pipeline layout used to program the push constant
    updates.
  * pname:stageFlags is a bitmask of elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits specifying
    the shader stages that will use the push constants in the updated range.
  * pname:offset is the start offset of the push constant range to update,
    in units of bytes.
  * pname:size is the size of the push constant range to update, in units of
    bytes.
  * pname:pValues is an array of pname:size bytes containing the new push
    constant values.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:stageFlags must: match exactly the shader stages used in
    pname:layout for the range specified by pname:offset and pname:size
  * pname:offset must: be a multiple of `4`
  * pname:size must: be a multiple of `4`
  * pname:offset must: be less than
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:maxPushConstantsSize
  * pname:size must: be less than or equal to
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:maxPushConstantsSize minus
    pname:offset
