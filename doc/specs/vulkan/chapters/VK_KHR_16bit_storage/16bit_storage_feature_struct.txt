To query features additionally supported by the +VK_KHR_16bit_storage+
extension, call flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR with a
sname:VkPhysicalDevice16BitStorageFeaturesKHR structure in the pname:pNext
chain.
The sname:VkPhysicalDevice16BitStorageFeaturesKHR structure can: also be in
the pname:pNext chain of a slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure, in which case
it controls which additional features are enabled in the device.

The slink:VkPhysicalDevice16BitStorageFeaturesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkPhysicalDevice16BitStorageFeaturesKHR.txt[]

   * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
   * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
   * [[features-features-storageBuffer16BitAccess]]
     pname:storageBuffer16BitAccess indicates whether objects in the
     code:StorageBuffer storage class with the code:Block decoration can:
     have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members.
     If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point
     members must: not be used in such objects.
     This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
     code:StorageBuffer16BitAccess capability.
   * [[features-features-uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess]]
     pname:uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess indicates whether objects in
     the code:Uniform storage class with the code:Block decoration and in
     the code:StorageBuffer storage class with the same decoration can:
     have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members.
     If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point
     members must: not be used in such objects.
     This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
     code:UniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess capability.
   * [[features-features-storagePushConstant16]]
     pname:storagePushConstant16 indicates whether objects in the
     code:PushConstant storage class can: have 16-bit integer and 16-bit
     floating-point members.
     If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or floating-point
     members must: not be used in such objects.
     This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
     code:StoragePushConstant16 capability.
   * [[features-features-storageInputOutput16]]
     pname:storageInputOutput16 indicates whether objects in the
     code:Input and code:Output storage classes can: have 16-bit integer and
     16-bit floating-point members.
     If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point
     members must: not be used in such objects.
     This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
     code:StorageInputOutput16 capability.
