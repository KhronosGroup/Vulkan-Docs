[[memory]]
= 内存分配

Vulkan 内存分为两类： _主机内存_ 和 _设备内存_ 。


[[memory-host]]
== 主机内存
主机内存是Vulkan实现需要的、设备不可见的内存。
这些内存可以用来存储软件内部数据。

[[memory-allocation]]
Vulkan给应用程序提供了代表Vulkan实现来操作主机内存分配的机会。
如果这个特征没有被使用，Vulkan实现将使用自己的内存分配函数。
因为大多数内存分配都不是在要求高性能代码区域的，这就不是一个提升性能的特征了。
相反，在一些嵌入式的平台上，这还是非常有用的，如为了调试（e.g. putting a guard page after all host allocations），
或者记录内存分配。

// refBegin VkAllocationCallbacks Structure containing callback function pointers for memory allocation

内存分配器是应用程序通过一个指向sname:VkAllocationCallbacks类型数据的指针来提供的。

include::../api/structs/VkAllocationCallbacks.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由回调自行解释的值。当sname:VkAllocationCallbacks之中任何回调函数被调用，Vulkan实现将把这个值作为第一个参数传递给回调函数。
	每一次被传递到命令中，这个值都可以改变，甚至在多个命令中同一个对象带有的内存分配器。
  * pname:pfnAllocation 是一个指向应用程序定义的内存分配函数的指针，类型为tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction。
  * pname:pfnReallocation 是一个指向应用程序定义的内存重分配函数的指针，类型为tlink:PFN_vkReallocationFunction。
  * pname:pfnFree 是一个指向应用程序定义的内存释放函数，类型为tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction。
  * pname:pfnInternalAllocation 是一个指向应用程序定义的函数的指针，当被Vulkan实现调用时，就进行内部内存分配，类型为  tlink:PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification。
  * pname:pfnInternalFree 是一个指向应用程序定义的函数的指针，当被Vulkan实现调用时，就释放内部内存，类型为tlink:PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification。

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:pfnAllocation 必须: 是一个有效的用户自定义的tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction 类型的函数指针。
  * pname:pfnReallocation 必须: 是一个指向有效的用户自定义的 tlink:PFN_vkReallocationFunction类型的函数指针。
  * pname:pfnFree 必须: 是一个指向有效的用户自定义的tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction类型指针。 
  * 如果 pname:pfnInternalAllocation 或者 pname:pfnInternalFree 不为 `NULL`，那么两个都必须: 是有效的回调函数。
****

include::../validity/structs/VkAllocationCallbacks.txt[]

// refBegin PFN_vkAllocationFunction Application-defined memory allocation function

pname:pfnAllocation定义如下：

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkAllocationFunction.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由应用程序指定的内存分配器的slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData 指定的。
  * pname:size 是要求分配的内存字节大小。
  * pname:alignment 是内存分配器要求的内存对齐的大小，以字节为单位，必须是2的幂。   
  * pname:allocationScope 是一个 elink:VkSystemAllocationScope 类型的值，指定了内存分配的生命周期，如  <<memory-host-allocation-scope, 这里>>所述。

[[vkAllocationFunction_return_rules]]
如果pname:pfnAllocation无法分配要求的内存，它必须返回 `NULL`。
如果分配成功，它必须返回包含至少 pname:size 字节内存的指针，且指针的数值必须是 pname:alignment的倍数。

[NOTE]
.注意
====
如果应用程序不遵守以下规则，就不能假定Vulkan会做正确的操作。

例如， pname:pfnAllocation（或者pname:pfnReallocation）在遇到
一次为了直接或者间接调试目的的内存分配失败时，能导致正在运行的Vulkan实例终止。
在这些情形下，不能假设受影响的VkInstance对象的任何部分将正常工作（甚至是flink:vkDestroyInstance），且应用程序
必须保证通过其他途径适当的做好清扫工作（比如进程终止）。
====

如果pname:pfnAllocation 返回`NULL`，且如果Vulkan实现因为没有获取要求的内存而不能正确的继续处理当前命令时，
Vulkan实现必须把这个当作是运行时错误，在合适的时候给发生这个状况的命令产生一个ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY错误，
如<<fundamentals-errorcodes, Return Codes>>中所描述。

如果Vulkan实现在没有获取到要求分配的内存时能够继续正确的处理当前命令，那么它不能
因这次内存分配失败而产生ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY。

// refEnd PFN_vkAllocationFunction VkAllocationCallbacks

// refBegin PFN_vkReallocationFunction Application-defined memory reallocation function

pname:pfnReallocation类型如下：

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkReallocationFunction.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由应用程序指定的内存分配器的slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData 指定的。
  * pname:pOriginal 必须: 是 `NULL` 或者是 同一个内存分配器的pname:pfnReallocation 或者 pname:pfnAllocation 返回的指针。
  * pname:size 是要求分配的内存字节大小。
  * pname:alignment 是内存分配器要求的内存对齐的大小，以字节为单位，必须是2的幂。   
  * pname:allocationScope 是一个 elink:VkSystemAllocationScope 类型的值，指定了内存分配的生命周期，如  <<memory-host-allocation-scope, 这里>>所述。

pname:pfnReallocation必须: 返回pname:size 字节的内存，原内存的内容从zero 到 [eq]#min(original size, new size) - 1# 必须: 被保留在新分配的内存中。
如果 pname:size比原来的内存要大, 附加部分内存的内容是未定义的。
如果满足这些创建新内存的条件，那么原来分配的内存应被释放掉了。

若 pname:pOriginal 是 `NULL`, 那么 pname:pfnReallocation 必须: 表现的和以相同参数（除了pname:pOriginal）调用tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction 表现完全相同。

若 pname:size 为0, 那么 pname:pfnReallocation 必须: 表现的和以相同参数pname:pUserData，pname:pMemory 等同于pname:pOriginal来调用 tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction 完全相同。 

若 pname:pOriginal 是 non-`NULL`, Vulkan实现必须 必须: 保证 pname:alignment 等于 分配pname:pOriginal时所用到的pname:alignment。

若这个函数调用失败，pname:pOriginal 是 non-`NULL`，应用程序不能: 释放掉原来的内存。

pname:pfnReallocation 必须: 符合<<vkAllocationFunction_return_rules, tname:PFN_vkAllocationFunction返回值的规则>>。

// refEnd PFN_vkReallocationFunction VkAllocationCallbacks

// refBegin PFN_vkFreeFunction Application-defined memory free function

pname:pfnFree 类型定义如下：

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkFreeFunction.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由应用程序指定的内存分配器的slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData 指定的。
  * pname:pMemory 是需要被释放的内存。

pname:pMemory 可能: 是 `NULL`, 此时回调函数 必须: 谨慎的处理。
若 pname:pMemory 是 non-`NULL`, 它必须: 是一个指针，指向 pname:pfnAllocation 或 pname:pfnReallocation之前分配的内存。
应用程序 应该: 释放此内存。

// refEnd PFN_vkFreeFunction VkAllocationCallbacks

// refBegin PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification Application-defined memory allocation notification function

pname:pfnInternalAllocation 类型定义如下:

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由应用程序指定的内存分配器的slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData 指定的。
  * pname:size 是要求分配的内存字节大小。
  * pname:allocationType 是要求的内存分配的类型。
  * pname:allocationScope 是一个 elink:VkSystemAllocationScope 类型的值，指定了内存分配的生命周期，如  <<memory-host-allocation-scope, 这里>>所述。

这是一个纯粹的查看信息的回调函数。

// refEnd PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification VkAllocationCallbacks

// refBegin PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification Application-defined memory free notification function

pname:pfnInternalFree定义如下:

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData 是由应用程序指定的内存分配器的slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData 指定的。
  * pname:size 是要求分配的内存字节大小。
  * pname:allocationType 是要求的内存分配的类型。
  * pname:allocationScope 是一个 elink:VkSystemAllocationScope 类型的值，指定了内存分配的生命周期，如  <<memory-host-allocation-scope, 这里>>所述。

// refEnd PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification VkAllocationCallbacks

// refBegin VkSystemAllocationScope Allocation scope

[[memory-host-allocation-scope]]
每一份分配的内存都有 _分配存活期_ ，定义了它自己的生命周期和所关联对象。
内存存活期是通过传递给slink:VkAllocationCallbacks中定义的回调函数的pname:allocationScope 参数提供的。
elink:VkSystemAllocationScope 定义的可选的值如下:

include::../api/enums/VkSystemAllocationScope.txt[]

  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND - The allocation is scoped to
    the duration of the Vulkan command.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT - The allocation is scoped to
    the lifetime of the Vulkan object that is being created or used.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE - The allocation is scoped to the
    lifetime of a sname:VkPipelineCache object.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE - The allocation is scoped to
    the lifetime of the Vulkan device.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE - The allocation is scoped to
    the lifetime of the Vulkan instance.

大多数Vulkan命令操作单个对象，或者创建、操控单一对象。当一份分配的内存使用 ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT 或
ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE时，内存的存活范围就是被创建或操控的对象。

当Vulkan实现获取主机端内存时，它将回调应用程序提供的回调函数来使用特定的内存分配器和内存存活范围：

  * If an allocation is scoped to the duration of a command, the allocator
    will use the ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND allocation scope.
    The most specific allocator available is used: if the object being
    created or manipulated has an allocator, that object's allocator will be
    used, else if the parent sname:VkDevice has an allocator it will be
    used, else if the parent sname:VkInstance has an allocator it will be
    used.
    Else,
  * If an allocation is associated with an object of type
    sname:VkPipelineCache, the allocator will use the
    ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE allocation scope.
    The most specific allocator available is used (pipeline cache, else
    device, else instance).
    Else,
  * If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an object, that object is
    being created or manipulated by the command, and that object's type is
    not sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance, the allocator will use an
    allocation scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT.
    The most specific allocator available is used (object, else device, else
    instance).
    Else,
  * If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of a device, the allocator
    will use an allocation scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE.
    The most specific allocator available is used (device, else instance).
    Else,
  * If the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an instance and the
    instance has an allocator, its allocator will be used with an allocation
    scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE.
  * Otherwise an implementation will allocate memory through an alternative
    mechanism that is unspecified.

// refEnd VkSystemAllocationScope VkAllocationCallbacks

从缓存池中分配出来的对象并没有指定它们对应的内存分配器。
当Vulkan实现为此对象获取主机端内存时，内存是由父缓存池的内存分配器获取的。

不应期待应用程序会负责主机端执行代码时处理内存分配活动，因为多平台上Vulkan实现的负责的安全性问题。
Vulkan实现将在内部分配内存，当这些内存分配或释放时，调用通知性的回调函数告诉应用程序。
当分配这些可执行的内存时，pname:pfnInternalAllocation 将会被调用。
当释放这些可执行的内存时，pname:pfnInternalFree 将被调用。
当分配或释放这些可执行的内存时，Vulkan实现将只调用通知性的回调函数。

// refBegin VkInternalAllocationType Allocation type

传递给 pname:pfnInternalAllocation 和pname:pfnInternalFree 函数的pname:allocationType 参数 可能: 是如下值:

include::../api/enums/VkInternalAllocationType.txt[]

  * ename:VK_INTERNAL_ALLOCATION_TYPE_EXECUTABLE - The allocation is
    intended for execution by the host.

// refEnd VkInternalAllocationType PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification

An implementation must: only make calls into an application-provided
allocator during the execution of an API command.
An implementation must: only make calls into an application-provided
allocator from the same thread that called the provoking API command.
The implementation should: not synchronize calls to any of the callbacks.
If synchronization is needed, the callbacks must: provide it themselves.
The informational callbacks are subject to the same restrictions as the
allocation callbacks.

If an implementation intends to make calls through an
sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structure between the time a ftext:vkCreate*
command returns and the time a corresponding ftext:vkDestroy* command
begins, that implementation must: save a copy of the allocator before the
ftext:vkCreate* command returns.
The callback functions and any data structures they rely upon must: remain
valid for the lifetime of the object they are associated with.

If an allocator is provided to a ftext:vkCreate* command, a _compatible_
allocator must: be provided to the corresponding ftext:vkDestroy* command.
Two sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structures are compatible if memory
allocated with pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation in each can: be
freed with pname:pfnReallocation or pname:pfnFree in the other.
An allocator must: not be provided to a ftext:vkDestroy* command if an
allocator was not provided to the corresponding ftext:vkCreate* command.

If a non-`NULL` allocator is used, the pname:pfnAllocation,
pname:pfnReallocation and pname:pfnFree members must: be non-`NULL` and
point to valid implementations of the callbacks.
An application can: choose to not provide informational callbacks by setting
both pname:pfnInternalAllocation and pname:pfnInternalFree to `NULL`.
pname:pfnInternalAllocation and pname:pfnInternalFree must: either both be
`NULL` or both be non-`NULL`.

If pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation fail, the implementation
may: fail object creation and/or generate an
ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY error, as appropriate.

Allocation callbacks must: not call any Vulkan commands.

The following sets of rules define when an implementation is permitted to
call the allocator callbacks.

pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation may: be called in the following
situations:

  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance may: be
    allocated from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a command may: be allocated from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkPipelineCache may: only be allocated
    from:
  ** fname:vkCreatePipelineCache
  ** fname:vkMergePipelineCaches for pname:dstCache
  ** fname:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines for pname:pPipelineCache
  ** fname:vkCreateComputePipelines for pname:pPipelineCache
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDescriptorPool may: only be allocated
    from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkAllocateDescriptorSets for the pname:descriptorPool member of
    its pname:pAllocateInfo parameter
  ** fname:vkCreateDescriptorPool
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkCommandPool may: only be allocated from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkCreateCommandPool
  ** fname:vkAllocateCommandBuffers for the pname:commandPool member of its
     pname:pAllocateInfo parameter
  ** any ftext:vkCmd* command whose pname:commandBuffer was allocated from
     that sname:VkCommandPool
  * Allocations scoped to any other object may: only be allocated in that
    object's ftext:vkCreate* command.

pname:pfnFree may: be called in the following situations:

  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance may: be freed
    from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a command must: be freed by any API command which
    allocates such memory.
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkPipelineCache may: be freed from
    fname:vkDestroyPipelineCache.
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDescriptorPool may: be freed from
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkCommandPool may: be freed from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkResetCommandBuffer whose pname:commandBuffer was allocated from
     that sname:VkCommandPool
  * Allocations scoped to any other object may: be freed in that object's
    ftext:vkDestroy* command.
  * Any command that allocates host memory may: also free host memory of the
    same scope.


[[memory-device]]
== 设备内存

设备内存是设备可见的内存，例如可以被设备原生访问的不透明图片的内容，或者常驻设备内存的统一缓冲区对象。

物理设备的内存属性描述了内存堆和可用的内存类型。

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties Reports memory information for the specified physical device

可调用如下命令来查询内存属性：

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice 是被查询内存所在的设备的handle。
  * pname:pMemoryProperties 指向sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties 类型的数据结构，属性信息由此返回。

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]

// refBegin VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties Structure specifying physical device memory properties

sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties数据类型定义如下：

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]

  * pname:memoryTypeCount is the number of valid elements in the
    pname:memoryTypes array.
  * pname:memoryTypes is an array of slink:VkMemoryType structures
    describing the _memory types_ that can: be used to access memory
    allocated from the heaps specified by pname:memoryHeaps.
  * pname:memoryHeapCount is the number of valid elements in the
    pname:memoryHeaps array.
  * pname:memoryHeaps is an array of slink:VkMemoryHeap structures
    describing the _memory heaps_ from which memory can: be allocated.

sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties 类型数据结构描述了多个 _memory heaps_ 和一系列 _memory types_ ，用这些type参数可以访问到从堆分配出来的内存。
每一个堆描述了特定大小的内存资源，每一个内存类型描述了内存的属性（例如，主机端缓存 vs 未缓存），属性需应用到内存堆上。
用特定内存类型分配内存将从 内存类型的堆索引表示的堆 中消耗资源。
多个内存类型可能共享一个内存对，堆和内存类型提供了一种机制，来通知物理内存资源的准确大小，且允许内存被用作各种用途。

内存堆的个数由 pname:memoryHeapCount 给出，比ename:VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS 要小。
每一个堆通过pname:memoryHeaps 数组中的一个元素（sname:VkMemoryHeap类型）来描述。
各个内存堆中可用的可用类型的个数由pname:memoryTypeCount 给出，不大于ename:VK_MAX_MEMORY_TYPES。
每一个内存类型通过pname:memoryTypes数组的一个元素（ sname:VkMemoryType 类型）来描述。

至少一个堆 必须：在slink:VkMemoryHeap::pname:flags 里包含ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT 标志位。
若有多个堆拥有类似的性能特点，它们可能都包含ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT。

在统一内存架构（UMA）系统中，经常只有单块儿内存堆，它被主机端和设备端都认为是"`local`" 的，这种情况下Vulkan实现必须要把内存堆声明为 device-local。

通过flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties 返回的每一个内存类型必须带有如下的标志位之一：

  * 0
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT |
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT

There must: be at least one memory type with both the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT and
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bits set in its
pname:propertyFlags.
There must: be at least one memory type with the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT bit set in its
pname:propertyFlags.

The memory types are sorted according to a preorder which serves to aid in
easily selecting an appropriate memory type.
Given two memory types X and Y, the preorder defines [eq]#X {leq} Y# if:

  * the memory property bits set for X are a strict subset of the memory
    property bits set for Y.
    Or,
  * the memory property bits set for X are the same as the memory property
    bits set for Y, and X uses a memory heap with greater or equal
    performance (as determined in an implementation-specific manner).

Memory types are ordered in the list such that X is assigned a lesser
pname:memoryTypeIndex than Y if [eq]#(X {leq} Y) {land} {lnot} (Y {leq} X)#
according to the preorder.
Note that the list of all allowed memory property flag combinations above
satisfies this preorder, but other orders would as well.
The goal of this ordering is to enable applications to use a simple search
loop in selecting the proper memory type, along the lines of:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
// Find a memory type in "memoryTypeBits" that includes all of "properties"
int32_t FindProperties(uint32_t memoryTypeBits, VkMemoryPropertyFlags properties)
{
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < memoryTypeCount; ++i)
    {
        if ((memoryTypeBits & (1 << i)) &&
            ((memoryTypes[i].propertyFlags & properties) == properties))
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

// Try to find an optimal memory type, or if it does not exist
// find any compatible memory type
VkMemoryRequirements memoryRequirements;
vkGetImageMemoryRequirements(device, image, &memoryRequirements);
int32_t memoryType = FindProperties(memoryRequirements.memoryTypeBits, optimalProperties);
if (memoryType == -1)
    memoryType = FindProperties(memoryRequirements.memoryTypeBits, requiredProperties);
---------------------------------------------------

The loop will find the first supported memory type that has all bits
requested in code:properties set.
If there is no exact match, it will find a closest match (i.e. a memory type
with the fewest additional bits set), which has some additional bits set but
which are not detrimental to the behaviors requested by code:properties.
The application can: first search for the optimal properties, e.g. a memory
type that is device-local or supports coherent cached accesses, as
appropriate for the intended usage, and if such a memory type is not present
can: fallback to searching for a less optimal but guaranteed set of
properties such as "0" or "host-visible and coherent".

// refBegin VkDeviceMemory Opaque handle to a device memory object

A Vulkan device operates on data in device memory via memory objects that
are represented in the API by a sname:VkDeviceMemory handle.

Memory objects are represented by sname:VkDeviceMemory handles:

include::../api/handles/VkDeviceMemory.txt[]

// refEnd VkDeviceMemory

// refBegin vkAllocateMemory Allocate GPU memory

可调用如下命令来分配内存对象：

include::../api/protos/vkAllocateMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device 是拥有内存的逻辑设备。
  * pname:pAllocateInfo 是一个指向slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo 类型对象的指针，描述了分配行为的参数。一次成功的内存分配必须要使用要求的参数，
	不允许Vulkan实现替换任何参数。
  * pname:pAllocator 控制了主机端内存分配，如 <<memory-allocation, 内存分配>> 一章所描述的。
  * pname:pMemory 是一个指向sname:VkDeviceMemory 类型handle的指针，通过它返回内存分配相关的信息。
  
fname:vkAllocateMemory返回的分配的内存被Vulkan实现保证按照要求对齐。
例如，应用程序要求对图像进行128 byte对齐，对缓冲区进行64 byte对齐，通过这种机制被返回的设备内存将按照128 byte对齐。
这保证应用程序能正确的在同一个内存对象中对不同的子类型进行内存分配（按照不同的内存对齐要求）。

当内存分配好了，它的内容是未定义的。

which can: be simultaneously created on a device.
This is specified by the
<<features-limits-maxMemoryAllocationCount,pname:maxMemoryAllocationCount>>
member of the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure.
If pname:maxMemoryAllocationCount is exceeded, fname:vkAllocateMemory will
return ename:VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS.

[NOTE]
.注意
====
Some platforms may: have a limit on the maximum size of a single allocation.
For example, certain systems may: fail to create allocations with a size
greater than or equal to 4GB.
Such a limit is implementation-dependent, and if such a failure occurs then
the error ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY should: be returned.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * The number of currently valid memory objects, allocated from
    pname:device, must: be less than

// refBegin vkFreeMemory Free GPU memory

To free a memory object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkFreeMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object to be freed.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

Before freeing a memory object, an application must: ensure the memory
object is no longer in use by the device--for example by command buffers
queued for execution.
The memory can: remain bound to images or buffers at the time the memory
object is freed, but any further use of them (on host or device) for
anything other than destroying those objects will result in undefined
behavior.
If there are still any bound images or buffers, the memory may: not be
immediately released by the implementation, but must: be released by the
time all bound images and buffers have been destroyed.
Once memory is released, it is returned to the heap from which it was
allocated.

How memory objects are bound to Images and Buffers is described in detail in
the <<resources-association, Resource Memory Association>> section.

If a memory object is mapped at the time it is freed, it is implicitly
unmapped.

.Valid Usage
****
  * All submitted commands that refer to pname:memory (via images or
    buffers) must: have completed execution

[[memory-device-hostaccess]]
=== Host Access to Device Memory Objects

Memory objects created with fname:vkAllocateMemory are not directly host
accessible.

Memory objects created with the memory property
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT are considered _mappable_.
Memory objects must: be mappable in order to be successfully mapped on the
host.

// refBegin vkMapMemory Map a memory object into application address space

To retrieve a host virtual address pointer to a region of a mappable memory
object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkMapMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object to be mapped.
  * pname:offset is a zero-based byte offset from the beginning of the
    memory object.
  * pname:size is the size of the memory range to map, or
    ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to map from pname:offset to the end of the
    allocation.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:ppData points to a pointer in which is returned a host-accessible
    pointer to the beginning of the mapped range.
    This pointer minus pname:offset must: be aligned to at least
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:minMemoryMapAlignment.

It is an application error to call fname:vkMapMemory on a memory object that
is already mapped.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
fname:vkMapMemory will fail if the implementation is unable to allocate an
appropriately sized contiguous virtual address range, e.g. due to virtual
address space fragmentation or platform limits.
In such cases, fname:vkMapMemory must: return VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED.
The application can: improve the likelihood of success by reducing the size
of the mapped range and/or removing unneeded mappings using
fname:VkUnmapMemory.
====

[[memory-device-hostaccess-hazards]]
fname:vkMapMemory does not check whether the device memory is currently in
use before returning the host-accessible pointer.
The application must: guarantee that any previously submitted command that
writes to this range has completed before the host reads from or writes to
that range, and that any previously submitted command that reads from that
range has completed before the host writes to that region (see
<<synchronization-submission-host-writes, here>> for details on fulfilling
such a guarantee).
If the device memory was allocated without the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, these guarantees must: be
made for an extended range: the application must: round down the start of
the range to the nearest multiple of
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize, and round the end
of the range up to the nearest multiple of
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize.

While a range of device memory is mapped for host access, the application is
responsible for synchronizing both device and host access to that memory
range.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
It is important for the application developer to become meticulously
familiar with all of the mechanisms described in the chapter on
<<synchronization, Synchronization and Cache Control>> as they are crucial
to maintaining memory access ordering.
====

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:memory must: not currently be mapped
  * pname:offset must: be less than the size of pname:memory
  * If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:size must: be
    greater than `0`
  * If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:size must: be
    less than or equal to the size of the pname:memory minus pname:offset
  * pname:memory must: have been created with a memory type that reports
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT

include::../validity/protos/vkMapMemory.txt[]

Two commands are provided to enable applications to work with non-coherent
memory allocations: fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and
fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If the memory object was created with the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set,
fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges are
unnecessary and may: have performance cost.
====

// refBegin vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges Flush mapped memory ranges

To flush ranges of non-coherent memory from the host caches, call:

include::../api/protos/vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory ranges.
  * pname:memoryRangeCount is the length of the pname:pMemoryRanges array.
  * pname:pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to
    flush.

fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges must: be used to guarantee that host writes
to non-coherent memory are visible to the device.
It must: be called after the host writes to non-coherent memory have
completed and before command buffers that will read or write any of those
memory locations are submitted to a queue.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Unmapping non-coherent memory does not implicitly flush the mapped memory,
and host writes that have not been flushed may: not ever be visible to the
device.
====

include::../validity/protos/vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

// refBegin vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges Invalidate ranges of mapped memory objects

To invalidate ranges of non-coherent memory from the host caches, call:

include::../api/protos/vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory ranges.
  * pname:memoryRangeCount is the length of the pname:pMemoryRanges array.
  * pname:pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to
    invalidate.

fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges must: be used to guarantee that device
writes to non-coherent memory are visible to the host.
It must: be called after command buffers that execute and flush (via memory
barriers) the device writes have completed, and before the host will read or
write any of those locations.
If a range of non-coherent memory is written by the host and then
invalidated without first being flushed, its contents are undefined.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Mapping non-coherent memory does not implicitly invalidate the mapped
memory, and device writes that have not been invalidated must: be made
visible before the host reads or overwrites them.
====

include::../validity/protos/vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

// refBegin VkMappedMemoryRange Structure specifying a mapped memory range

The sname:VkMappedMemoryRange structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkMappedMemoryRange.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:memory is the memory object to which this range belongs.
  * pname:offset is the zero-based byte offset from the beginning of the
    memory object.
  * pname:size is either the size of range, or ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to affect
    the range from pname:offset to the end of the current mapping of the
    allocation.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:memory must: currently be mapped
  * If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:offset and
    pname:size must: specify a range contained within the currently mapped
    range of pname:memory
  * If pname:size is equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:offset must: be
    within the currently mapped range of pname:memory
  * pname:offset must: be a multiple of
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize
  * If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:size must: be a
    multiple of sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize

TODO (Tobias) - There's a circular section reference between this next

The information is all covered by both places, but it seems a bit weird to
have them reference each other.
Not sure how to resolve it.

endif::editing-notes[]

Host-visible memory types that advertise the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT property still require
<<synchronization-pipeline-barriers,memory barriers>> between host and
device in order to be coherent, but do not require additional cache
management operations to achieve coherency.
For host writes to be seen by subsequent command buffer operations, a
pipeline barrier from a source of ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT and
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT to a destination of the relevant device
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages, pipeline stages>> and
<<synchronization-access-types, access types>> must: be performed.
Note that such a barrier is performed
<<synchronization-submission-host-writes,implicitly>> upon each command
buffer submission, so an explicit barrier is only rarely needed (e.g. if a
command buffer waits upon an event signaled by the host, where the host
wrote some data after submission).
A pipeline barrier is required: to make writes visible to subsequent reads
on the host.

// refBegin vkUnmapMemory Unmap a previously mapped memory object

To unmap a memory object once host access to it is no longer needed by the
application, call:

include::../api/protos/vkUnmapMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the memory object to be unmapped.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:memory must: currently be mapped

[[memory-device-lazy_allocation]]
=== 惰性内存分配

If the memory object is allocated from a heap with the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT bit set, that object's backing
memory may: be provided by the implementation lazily.
The actual committed size of the memory may: initially be as small as zero
(or as large as the requested size), and monotonically increases as
additional memory is needed.

A memory type with this flag set is only allowed to be bound to a
sname:VkImage whose usage flags include
ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT.

[NOTE]
.注意
====
Using lazily allocated memory objects for framebuffer attachments that are
not needed once a render pass instance has completed may: allow some
implementations to never allocate memory for such attachments.
====

// refBegin vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment Query the current commitment for a VkDeviceMemory

To determine the amount of lazily-allocated memory that is currently
committed for a memory object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the memory object being queried.
  * pname:pCommittedMemoryInBytes is a pointer to a basetype:VkDeviceSize
    value in which the number of bytes currently committed is returned, on
    success.

The implementation may: update the commitment at any time, and the value
returned by this query may: be out of date.

The implementation guarantees to allocate any committed memory from the
heapIndex indicated by the memory type that the memory object was created
with.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:memory must: have been created with a memory type that reports
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT
