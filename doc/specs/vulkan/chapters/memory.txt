[[memory]]
= Memory Allocation

Vulkan memory is broken up into two categories, _host memory_ and _device
memory_.


[[memory-host]]
== Host Memory

Host memory is memory needed by the Vulkan implementation for
non-device-visible storage.
This storage may: be used for e.g. internal software structures.

[[memory-allocation]]
Vulkan provides applications the opportunity to perform host memory
allocations on behalf of the Vulkan implementation.
If this feature is not used, the implementation will perform its own memory
allocations.
Since most memory allocations are off the critical path, this is not meant
as a performance feature.
Rather, this can: be useful for certain embedded systems, for debugging
purposes (e.g. putting a guard page after all host allocations), or for
memory allocation logging.

[open,refpage='VkAllocationCallbacks',desc='Structure containing callback function pointers for memory allocation',type='structs']
--

Allocators are provided by the application as a pointer to a
sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structure:

include::../api/structs/VkAllocationCallbacks.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData is a value to be interpreted by the implementation of
    the callbacks.
    When any of the callbacks in sname:VkAllocationCallbacks are called, the
    Vulkan implementation will pass this value as the first parameter to the
    callback.
    This value can: vary each time an allocator is passed into a command,
    even when the same object takes an allocator in multiple commands.
  * pname:pfnAllocation is a pointer to an application-defined memory
    allocation function of type tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction.
  * pname:pfnReallocation is a pointer to an application-defined memory
    reallocation function of type tlink:PFN_vkReallocationFunction.
  * pname:pfnFree is a pointer to an application-defined memory free
    function of type tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction.
  * pname:pfnInternalAllocation is a pointer to an application-defined
    function that is called by the implementation when the implementation
    makes internal allocations, and it is of type
    tlink:PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification.
  * pname:pfnInternalFree is a pointer to an application-defined function
    that is called by the implementation when the implementation frees
    internal allocations, and it is of type
    tlink:PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification.

The type of pname:pfnAllocation is:

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkAllocationFunction.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData is the value specified for
    slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData in the allocator specified
    by the application.
  * pname:size is the size in bytes of the requested allocation.
  * pname:alignment is the requested alignment of the allocation in bytes
    and must: be a power of two.
  * pname:allocationScope is a elink:VkSystemAllocationScope value
    specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as
    described <<memory-host-allocation-scope,here>>.

[[vkAllocationFunction_return_rules]]
If pname:pfnAllocation is unable to allocate the requested memory, it must:
return `NULL`.
If the allocation was successful, it must: return a valid pointer to memory
allocation containing at least pname:size bytes, and with the pointer value
being a multiple of pname:alignment.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Correct Vulkan operation cannot: be assumed if the application does not
follow these rules.

For example, pname:pfnAllocation (or pname:pfnReallocation) could cause
termination of running Vulkan instance(s) on a failed allocation for
debugging purposes, either directly or indirectly.
In these circumstances, it cannot: be assumed that any part of any affected
VkInstance objects are going to operate correctly (even
flink:vkDestroyInstance), and the application must: ensure it cleans up
properly via other means (e.g. process termination).
====

If pname:pfnAllocation returns `NULL`, and if the implementation is unable
to continue correct processing of the current command without the requested
allocation, it must: treat this as a run-time error, and generate
ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY at the appropriate time for the command in
which the condition was detected, as described in <<fundamentals-errorcodes,
Return Codes>>.

If the implementation is able to continue correct processing of the current
command without the requested allocation, then it may: do so, and must: not
generate ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY as a result of this failed
allocation.

--

The type of pname:pfnReallocation is:

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkReallocationFunction.txt[]

  * pname:pUserData is the value specified for
    slink:VkAllocationCallbacks::pname:pUserData in the allocator specified
    by the application.
  * pname:pOriginal must: be either `NULL` or a pointer previously returned
    by pname:pfnReallocation or pname:pfnAllocation of the same allocator.
  * pname:size is the size in bytes of the requested allocation.
  * pname:alignment is the requested alignment of the allocation in bytes
    and must: be a power of two.
  * pname:allocationScope is a elink:VkSystemAllocationScope value
    specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as
    described <<memory-host-allocation-scope,here>>.

pname:pfnReallocation must: return an allocation with enough space for
pname:size bytes, and the contents of the original allocation from bytes
zero to [eq]#min(original size, new size) - 1# must: be preserved in the
returned allocation.
If pname:size is larger than the old size, the contents of the additional
space are undefined.
If satisfying these requirements involves creating a new allocation, then
the old allocation should: be freed.

If pname:pOriginal is `NULL`, then pname:pfnReallocation must: behave
equivalently to a call to tlink:PFN_vkAllocationFunction with the same
parameter values (without pname:pOriginal).

If pname:size is zero, then pname:pfnReallocation must: behave equivalently
to a call to tlink:PFN_vkFreeFunction with the same pname:pUserData
parameter value, and pname:pMemory equal to pname:pOriginal.

If pname:pOriginal is non-`NULL`, the implementation must: ensure that
pname:alignment is equal to the pname:alignment used to originally allocate
pname:pOriginal.

If this function fails and pname:pOriginal is non-`NULL` the application
must: not free the old allocation.

pname:pfnReallocation must: follow the same
<<vkAllocationFunction_return_rules, rules for return values as
tname:PFN_vkAllocationFunction>>.

  * pname:pUserData is the value specified for

  * pname:pMemory is the allocation to be freed.

pname:pMemory may: be `NULL`, which the callback must: handle safely.
If pname:pMemory is non-`NULL`, it must: be a pointer previously allocated
by pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation.
The application should: free this memory.

[[memory-host-allocation-scope]]
Each allocation has an _allocation scope_ which defines its lifetime and
which object it is associated with.
Possible values passed to the pname:allocationScope parameter of the
callback functions specified by slink:VkAllocationCallbacks, indicating the
allocation scope, are:

include::../api/enums/VkSystemAllocationScope.txt[]

  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND specifies that the allocation
    is scoped to the duration of the Vulkan command.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT specifies that the allocation is
    scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan object that is being created or
    used.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE specifies that the allocation is
    scoped to the lifetime of a sname:VkPipelineCache
ifdef::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
    or sname:VkValidationCacheEXT
endif::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
    object.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE specifies that the allocation is
    scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan device.
  * ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE specifies that the allocation
    is scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan instance.

Most Vulkan commands operate on a single object, or there is a sole object
that is being created or manipulated.
When an allocation uses an allocation scope of
ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT or
ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE, the allocation is scoped to the
object being created or manipulated.

When an implementation requires host memory, it will make callbacks to the
application using the most specific allocator and allocation scope
available:

  * If an allocation is scoped to the duration of a command, the allocator
    will use the ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND allocation scope.
    The most specific allocator available is used: if the object being
    created or manipulated has an allocator, that object's allocator will be
    used, else if the parent sname:VkDevice has an allocator it will be
    used, else if the parent sname:VkInstance has an allocator it will be
    used.
    Else,
  * If an allocation is associated with an object of type
ifdef::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
    sname:VkValidationCacheEXT or
endif::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
    sname:VkPipelineCache, the allocator will use the
    ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE allocation scope.
    The most specific allocator available is used (cache, else device, else
    instance).
    Else,
  * If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an object, that object is
    being created or manipulated by the command, and that object's type is
    not sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance, the allocator will use an
    allocation scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT.
    The most specific allocator available is used (object, else device, else
    instance).
    Else,
  * If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of a device, the allocator
    will use an allocation scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE.
    The most specific allocator available is used (device, else instance).
    Else,
  * If the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an instance and the
    instance has an allocator, its allocator will be used with an allocation
    scope of ename:VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE.
  * Otherwise an implementation will allocate memory through an alternative
    mechanism that is unspecified.

--

Objects that are allocated from pools do not specify their own allocator.
When an implementation requires host memory for such an object, that memory
is sourced from the object's parent pool's allocator.

The application is not expected to handle allocating memory that is intended
for execution by the host due to the complexities of differing security
implementations across multiple platforms.
The implementation will allocate such memory internally and invoke an
application provided informational callback when these _internal
allocations_ are allocated and freed.
Upon allocation of executable memory, pname:pfnInternalAllocation will be
called.
Upon freeing executable memory, pname:pfnInternalFree will be called.
An implementation will only call an informational callback for executable
memory allocations and frees.

[open,refpage='VkInternalAllocationType',desc='Allocation type',type='enums',xrefs='PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification']
--

The pname:allocationType parameter to the pname:pfnInternalAllocation and
pname:pfnInternalFree functions may: be one of the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkInternalAllocationType.txt[]

  * ename:VK_INTERNAL_ALLOCATION_TYPE_EXECUTABLE specifies that the
    allocation is intended for execution by the host.

--

An implementation must: only make calls into an application-provided
allocator during the execution of an API command.
An implementation must: only make calls into an application-provided
allocator from the same thread that called the provoking API command.
The implementation should: not synchronize calls to any of the callbacks.
If synchronization is needed, the callbacks must: provide it themselves.
The informational callbacks are subject to the same restrictions as the
allocation callbacks.

If an implementation intends to make calls through an
sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structure between the time a ftext:vkCreate*
command returns and the time a corresponding ftext:vkDestroy* command
begins, that implementation must: save a copy of the allocator before the
ftext:vkCreate* command returns.
The callback functions and any data structures they rely upon must: remain
valid for the lifetime of the object they are associated with.

If an allocator is provided to a ftext:vkCreate* command, a _compatible_
allocator must: be provided to the corresponding ftext:vkDestroy* command.
Two sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structures are compatible if memory
allocated with pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation in each can: be
freed with pname:pfnReallocation or pname:pfnFree in the other.
An allocator must: not be provided to a ftext:vkDestroy* command if an
allocator was not provided to the corresponding ftext:vkCreate* command.

If a non-`NULL` allocator is used, the pname:pfnAllocation,
pname:pfnReallocation and pname:pfnFree members must: be non-`NULL` and
point to valid implementations of the callbacks.
An application can: choose to not provide informational callbacks by setting
both pname:pfnInternalAllocation and pname:pfnInternalFree to `NULL`.
pname:pfnInternalAllocation and pname:pfnInternalFree must: either both be
`NULL` or both be non-`NULL`.

If pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation fail, the implementation
may: fail object creation and/or generate an
ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY error, as appropriate.

Allocation callbacks must: not call any Vulkan commands.

The following sets of rules define when an implementation is permitted to
call the allocator callbacks.

pname:pfnAllocation or pname:pfnReallocation may: be called in the following
situations:

  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance may: be
    allocated from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a command may: be allocated from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkPipelineCache may: only be allocated
    from:
  ** fname:vkCreatePipelineCache
  ** fname:vkMergePipelineCaches for pname:dstCache
  ** fname:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines for pname:pipelineCache
  ** fname:vkCreateComputePipelines for pname:pipelineCache
ifdef::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkValidationCacheEXT may: only be
    allocated from:
  ** fname:vkCreateValidationCacheEXT
  ** fname:vkMergeValidationCachesEXT for pname:dstCache
  ** fname:vkCreateShaderModule for pname:validationCache in
     sname:VkShaderModuleValidationCacheCreateInfoEXT
endif::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDescriptorPool may: only be allocated
    from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkAllocateDescriptorSets for the pname:descriptorPool member of
    its pname:pAllocateInfo parameter
  ** fname:vkCreateDescriptorPool
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkCommandPool may: only be allocated from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkCreateCommandPool
  ** fname:vkAllocateCommandBuffers for the pname:commandPool member of its
     pname:pAllocateInfo parameter
  ** any ftext:vkCmd* command whose pname:commandBuffer was allocated from
     that sname:VkCommandPool
  * Allocations scoped to any other object may: only be allocated in that
    object's ftext:vkCreate* command.

pname:pfnFree may: be called in the following situations:

  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDevice or sname:VkInstance may: be freed
    from any API command.
  * Allocations scoped to a command must: be freed by any API command which
    allocates such memory.
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkPipelineCache may: be freed from
    fname:vkDestroyPipelineCache.
ifdef::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkValidationCacheEXT may: be freed from
    fname:vkDestroyValidationCacheEXT.
endif::VK_EXT_validation_cache[]
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkDescriptorPool may: be freed from
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  * Allocations scoped to a sname:VkCommandPool may: be freed from:
  ** any command that takes the pool as a direct argument
  ** fname:vkResetCommandBuffer whose pname:commandBuffer was allocated from
     that sname:VkCommandPool
  * Allocations scoped to any other object may: be freed in that object's
    ftext:vkDestroy* command.
  * Any command that allocates host memory may: also free host memory of the
    same scope.


[[memory-device]]
== Device Memory

_Device memory_ is memory that is visible to the device -- for example the
contents of the image or buffer objects, which can: be natively used by the
device.

Memory properties of a physical device describe the memory heaps and memory
types available.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties',desc='Reports memory information for the specified physical device',type='protos']
--

To query memory properties, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the device to query.
  * pname:pMemoryProperties points to an instance of
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure in which the properties
    are returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties',desc='Structure specifying physical device memory properties',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.txt[]

  * pname:memoryTypeCount is the number of valid elements in the
    pname:memoryTypes array.
  * pname:memoryTypes is an array of slink:VkMemoryType structures
    describing the _memory types_ that can: be used to access memory
    allocated from the heaps specified by pname:memoryHeaps.
  * pname:memoryHeapCount is the number of valid elements in the
    pname:memoryHeaps array.
  * pname:memoryHeaps is an array of slink:VkMemoryHeap structures
    describing the _memory heaps_ from which memory can: be allocated.

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure describes a number of
_memory heaps_ as well as a number of _memory types_ that can: be used to
access memory allocated in those heaps.
Each heap describes a memory resource of a particular size, and each memory
type describes a set of memory properties (e.g. host cached vs uncached)
that can: be used with a given memory heap.
Allocations using a particular memory type will consume resources from the
heap indicated by that memory type's heap index.
More than one memory type may: share each heap, and the heaps and memory
types provide a mechanism to advertise an accurate size of the physical
memory resources while allowing the memory to be used with a variety of
different properties.

The number of memory heaps is given by pname:memoryHeapCount and is less
than or equal to ename:VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS.
Each heap is described by an element of the pname:memoryHeaps array as a
slink:VkMemoryHeap structure.
The number of memory types available across all memory heaps is given by
pname:memoryTypeCount and is less than or equal to
ename:VK_MAX_MEMORY_TYPES.
Each memory type is described by an element of the pname:memoryTypes array
as a slink:VkMemoryType structure.

At least one heap must: include ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT in
slink:VkMemoryHeap::pname:flags.
If there are multiple heaps that all have similar performance
characteristics, they may: all include
ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT.
In a unified memory architecture (UMA) system there is often only a single
memory heap which is considered to be equally "`local`" to the host and to
the device, and such an implementation must: advertise the heap as
device-local.

[[memory-device-bitmask-list]]
Each memory type returned by flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties must:
have its pname:propertyFlags set to one of the following values:

  * 0
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
  * ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | +
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT

There must: be at least one memory type with both the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT and
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bits set in its
pname:propertyFlags.
There must: be at least one memory type with the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT bit set in its
pname:propertyFlags.

For each pair of elements *X* and *Y* returned in pname:memoryTypes, *X*
must: be placed at a lower index position than *Y* if:

  * either the set of bit flags returned in the pname:propertyFlags member
    of *X* is a strict subset of the set of bit flags returned in the
    pname:propertyFlags member of *Y*.
  * or the pname:propertyFlags members of *X* and *Y* are equal, and *X*
    belongs to a memory heap with greater performance (as determined in an
    implementation-specific manner).

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no ordering requirement between *X* and *Y* elements for the case
their pname:propertyFlags members are not in a subset relation.
That potentially allows more than one possible way to order the same set of
memory types.
Notice that the <<memory-device-bitmask-list,list of all allowed memory
property flag combinations>> is written in the required order.
But if instead ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT was before
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT, the list would still be in the
required order.
====

This ordering requirement enables applications to use a simple search loop
to select the desired memory type along the lines of:

[source,c++]
---------------------------------------------------
// Find a memory in `memoryTypeBitsRequirement` that includes all of `requiredProperties`
int32_t findProperties(const VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties* pMemoryProperties,

    const uint32_t memoryCount = pMemoryProperties->memoryTypeCount;
    for (uint32_t memoryIndex = 0; memoryIndex < memoryCount; ++memoryIndex) {
        const uint32_t memoryTypeBits = (1 << memoryIndex);
        const bool isRequiredMemoryType = memoryTypeBitsRequirement & memoryTypeBits;

            pMemoryProperties->memoryTypes[memoryIndex].propertyFlags;
        const bool hasRequiredProperties =

        if (isRequiredMemoryType && hasRequiredProperties)
            return static_cast<int32_t>(memoryIndex);
    }

    // failed to find memory type
    return -1;
}

VkMemoryRequirements memoryRequirements;
vkGetImageMemoryRequirements(device, image, &memoryRequirements);
int32_t memoryType =
    findProperties(&memoryProperties, memoryRequirements.memoryTypeBits, optimalProperties);
if (memoryType == -1) // not found; try fallback properties
    memoryType =

A Vulkan device operates on data in device memory via memory objects that
are represented in the API by a sname:VkDeviceMemory handle:

include::../api/handles/VkDeviceMemory.txt[]

--

[open,refpage='vkAllocateMemory',desc='Allocate GPU memory',type='protos']
--

To allocate memory objects, call:

include::../api/protos/vkAllocateMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:pAllocateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure describing parameters of the
    allocation.
    A successful returned allocation must: use the requested parameters --
    no substitution is permitted by the implementation.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pMemory is a pointer to a sname:VkDeviceMemory handle in which
    information about the allocated memory is returned.

Allocations returned by fname:vkAllocateMemory are guaranteed to meet any
alignment requirement of the implementation.
For example, if an implementation requires 128 byte alignment for images and
64 byte alignment for buffers, the device memory returned through this
mechanism would be 128-byte aligned.
This ensures that applications can: correctly suballocate objects of
different types (with potentially different alignment requirements) in the
same memory object.

When memory is allocated, its contents are undefined.

There is an implementation-dependent maximum number of memory allocations
that can: be simultaneously created on a device.
This is specified by the
<<features-limits-maxMemoryAllocationCount,pname:maxMemoryAllocationCount>>
member of the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure.
If pname:maxMemoryAllocationCount is exceeded, fname:vkAllocateMemory will
return ename:VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS.

Some platforms may: have a limit on the maximum size of a single allocation.
For example, certain systems may: fail to create allocations with a size
greater than or equal to 4GB.
Such a limit is implementation-dependent, and if such a failure occurs then
the error ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY must: be returned.

from the exporting Vulkan instance or vice-versa.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
How exported and imported memory is isolated is left to the implementation,
but applications should be aware that such isolation may: prevent
implementations from placing multiple exportable memory objects in the same
physical or virtual page.
Hence, applications should: avoid creating many small external memory
objects whenever possible.
====

When performing a memory import operation, it is the responsibility of the
application to ensure the external handles meet all valid usage
requirements.
However, implementations must: perform sufficient validation of external
handles to ensure that the operation results in a valid memory object which
will not cause program termination, device loss, queue stalls, or corruption
of other resources when used as allowed according to its allocation
parameters.
If the external handle provided does not meet these requirements, the
implementation must: fail the memory import operation with the error code

  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object to be freed.

Before freeing a memory object, an application must: ensure the memory
object is no longer in use by the device--for example by command buffers in
the _pending state_.
The memory can: remain bound to images or buffers at the time the memory
object is freed, but any further use of them (on host or device) for
anything other than destroying those objects will result in undefined
behavior.
If there are still any bound images or buffers, the memory may: not be
immediately released by the implementation, but must: be released by the
time all bound images and buffers have been destroyed.
Once memory is released, it is returned to the heap from which it was
allocated.

How memory objects are bound to Images and Buffers is described in detail in
the <<resources-association, Resource Memory Association>> section.

If a memory object is mapped at the time it is freed, it is implicitly
unmapped.

=== Host Access to Device Memory Objects

Memory objects created with flink:vkAllocateMemory are not directly host
accessible.

ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT are considered _mappable_.
Memory objects must: be mappable in order to be successfully mapped on the
host.

[open,refpage='vkMapMemory',desc='Map a memory object into application address space',type='protos']
--

To retrieve a host virtual address pointer to a region of a mappable memory
object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkMapMemory.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object to be mapped.
  * pname:offset is a zero-based byte offset from the beginning of the
    memory object.
  * pname:size is the size of the memory range to map, or
    ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to map from pname:offset to the end of the
    allocation.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:ppData points to a pointer in which is returned a host-accessible
    pointer to the beginning of the mapped range.
    This pointer minus pname:offset must: be aligned to at least
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:minMemoryMapAlignment.

It is an application error to call fname:vkMapMemory on a memory object that
is already mapped.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
fname:vkMapMemory will fail if the implementation is unable to allocate an
appropriately sized contiguous virtual address range, e.g. due to virtual
address space fragmentation or platform limits.
In such cases, fname:vkMapMemory must: return
ename:VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED.
The application can: improve the likelihood of success by reducing the size
of the mapped range and/or removing unneeded mappings using
fname:VkUnmapMemory.
====

[[memory-device-hostaccess-hazards]]
fname:vkMapMemory does not check whether the device memory is currently in
use before returning the host-accessible pointer.
The application must: guarantee that any previously submitted command that
writes to this range has completed before the host reads from or writes to
that range, and that any previously submitted command that reads from that
range has completed before the host writes to that region (see
<<synchronization-submission-host-writes, here>> for details on fulfilling
such a guarantee).
If the device memory was allocated without the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, these guarantees must: be
made for an extended range: the application must: round down the start of
the range to the nearest multiple of
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize, and round the end
of the range up to the nearest multiple of
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:nonCoherentAtomSize.

While a range of device memory is mapped for host access, the application is
responsible for synchronizing both device and host access to that memory
range.

[NOTE]

It is important for the application developer to become meticulously
familiar with all of the mechanisms described in the chapter on
<<synchronization, Synchronization and Cache Control>> as they are crucial

    flush.

fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges guarantees that host writes to the memory
ranges described by pname:pMemoryRanges can: be made available to device
access, via <<synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible,

[[memory-device-unmap-does-not-flush]]
Unmapping non-coherent memory does not implicitly flush the mapped memory,
and host writes that have not been flushed may: not ever be visible to the
device.
However, implementations must: ensure that writes that have not been flushed
do not become visible to any other memory.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The above guarantee avoids a potential memory corruption in scenarios where
host writes to a mapped memory object have not been flushed before the
memory is unmapped (or freed), and the virtual address range is subsequently
reused for a different mapping (or memory allocation).

  * pname:pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to

fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges guarantees that device writes to the
memory ranges described by pname:pMemoryRanges, which have been made visible
to the ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT and ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT
<<synchronization-access-types, access types>>, are made visible to the

If a range of non-coherent memory is written by the host and then
invalidated without first being flushed, its contents are undefined.

=== Peer Memory Features

[open,refpage='vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX',desc='Query supported peer memory features of a device',type='protos']
--

_Peer memory_ is memory that is allocated for a given physical device and
then bound to a resource and accessed by a different physical device, in a
logical device that represents multiple physical devices.
Some ways of reading and writing peer memory may: not be supported by a
device.

To determine how peer memory can: be accessed, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:heapIndex is the index of the memory heap from which the memory is
    allocated.
  * pname:localDeviceIndex is the device index of the physical device that
    performs the memory access.
  * pname:remoteDeviceIndex is the device index of the physical device that
    the memory is allocated for.
  * pname:pPeerMemoryFeatures is a pointer to a bitmask of
    elink:VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBitsKHX indicating which types of memory
    accesses are supported for the combination of heap, local, and remote
    devices.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX-heapIndex-00691]]
    pname:heapIndex must: be less than pname:memoryHeapCount
  * [[VUID-vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX-localDeviceIndex-00692]]
    pname:localDeviceIndex must: be a valid device index
  * [[VUID-vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX-remoteDeviceIndex-00693]]
    pname:remoteDeviceIndex must: be a valid device index
  * [[VUID-vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX-localDeviceIndex-00694]]
    pname:localDeviceIndex must: not equal remoteDeviceIndex

Bits which may: be set in the value returned for
flink:vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHX::pname:pPeerMemoryFeatures,
indicating the supported peer memory features, are:

include::../api/enums/VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBitsKHX.txt[]

  * ename:VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_SRC_BIT_KHX indicates that the memory
    can: be accessed as the source of a ftext:vkCmdCopyBuffer,
    ftext:vkCmdCopyImage, ftext:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage, or
    ftext:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer command.
  * ename:VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT_KHX indicates that the memory
    can: be accessed as the destination of a ftext:vkCmdCopyBuffer,
    ftext:vkCmdCopyImage, ftext:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage, or
    ftext:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer command.
  * ename:VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT_KHX indicates that the
    memory can: be read as any memory access type.
  * ename:VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT_KHX indicates that the
    memory can: be written as any memory access type.
    Shader atomics are considered to be writes.

ename:VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT_KHX must: be supported for all
host local heaps and for at least one device local heap.

If a device does not support a peer memory feature, it is still valid to use
a resource that includes both local and peer memory bindings with the
corresponding access type as long as only the local bindings are actually
accessed.
For example, an application doing split-frame rendering would use
framebuffer attachments that include both local and peer memory bindings,
but would scissor the rendering to only update local memory.
