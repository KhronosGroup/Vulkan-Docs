[[features]]
= Features, Limits, and Formats

Vulkan is designed to support a wide range of hardware and as such there are
a number of features, limits, and formats which are not supported on all
hardware.
Features describe functionality that is not required: and which must: be
explicitly enabled.
Limits describe implementation-dependent minimums, maximums, and other
device characteristics that an application may: need to be aware of.
Supported buffer and image formats may: vary across implementations.
A minimum set of format features are guaranteed, but others must: be
explicitly queried before use to ensure they are supported by the
implementation.

[NOTE]
.Note on extensibility
====
The features and limits are reported via basic structures (that is
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures and slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits), as well as
extensible structures (sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR and
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR) which were added in
code:VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2.
When new features or limits are added in future Vulkan version or
extensions, each extension should: introduce one new feature structure
and/or limit structure (as needed).
These structures can: be added to the pname:pNext chain of the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR and sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR
structures, respectively.
====

[[features-features]]
== Features

The Specification defines a set of fine-grained features that are not
required:, but may: be supported by a Vulkan implementation.
Support for features is reported and enabled on a per-feature basis.
Features are properties of the physical device.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures',desc='Reports capabilities of a physical device',type='protos']
--

To query supported features, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    structure in which the physical device features are returned.
    For each feature, a value of ename:VK_TRUE indicates that the feature is
    supported on this physical device, and ename:VK_FALSE indicates that the
    feature is not supported.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]
--

Fine-grained features used by a logical device must: be enabled at
sname:VkDevice creation time.
If a feature is enabled that the physical device does not support,
sname:VkDevice creation will fail.
If an application uses a feature without enabling it at sname:VkDevice
creation time, the device behavior is undefined.
The validation layer will warn if features are used without being enabled.

The fine-grained features are enabled by passing a pointer to the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure via the pname:pEnabledFeatures
member of the sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure that is passed into the
fname:vkCreateDevice call.
If a member of pname:pEnabledFeatures is set to ename:VK_TRUE or
ename:VK_FALSE, then the device will be created with the indicated feature
enabled or disabled, respectively.
ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
Features can: also be enabled by using the
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure.
endif::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

If an application wishes to enable all features supported by a device, it
can: simply pass in the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure that was
previously returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.
To disable an individual feature, the application can: set the desired
member to ename:VK_FALSE in the same structure.
Setting pname:pEnabledFeatures to `NULL`
ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
and not including a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR in the pname:pNext
member of slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo
endif::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
is equivalent to setting all members of the structure to ename:VK_FALSE.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Some features, such as pname:robustBufferAccess, may: incur a run-time
performance cost.
Application writers should: carefully consider the implications of enabling
all supported features.

ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR',desc='Reports capabilities of a physical device',type='protos']
--

To query supported features defined by the core or extensions, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR
    structure in which the physical device features are returned.

Each structure in pname:pFeatures and its pname:pNext chain contain members
corresponding to fine-grained features.
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR writes each member to a boolean value
indicating whether that feature is supported.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR',desc='Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure is defined as:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:features is a structure of type slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    describing the fine-grained features of the Vulkan 1.0 API.

The pname:pNext chain of this structure is used to extend the structure with
features defined by extensions.
This structure can: be used in flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR or can:
be in the pname:pNext chain of a slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure, in
which case it controls which features are enabled in the device in lieu of
pname:pEnabledFeatures.

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures',desc='Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure describe the
following features:

  * [[features-features-robustBufferAccess]] pname:robustBufferAccess
    indicates that accesses to buffers are bounds-checked against the range
    of the buffer descriptor (as determined by
    sname:VkDescriptorBufferInfo::pname:range,
    sname:VkBufferViewCreateInfo::pname:range, or the size of the buffer).
    Out of bounds accesses must: not cause application termination, and the
    effects of shader loads, stores, and atomics must: conform to an
    implementation-dependent behavior as described below.
  ** A buffer access is considered to be out of bounds if any of the
     following are true:
  *** The pointer was formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the coordinate
      is less than zero or greater than or equal to the number of whole
      elements in the bound range.
  *** The pointer was not formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the object
      pointed to is not wholly contained within the bound range.
ifdef::VK_KHR_variable_pointers[]
      This includes accesses performed via _variable pointers_ where the
      buffer descriptor being accessed cannot be statically determined.
      Uninitialized pointers and pointers equal to code:OpConstantNull are
      treated as pointing to a zero-sized object, so all accesses through
      such pointers are considered to be out of bounds.
endif::VK_KHR_variable_pointers[]
+
[NOTE]
.Note
====
If a SPIR-V code:OpLoad instruction loads a structure and the tail end of
the structure is out of bounds, then all members of the structure are
considered out of bounds even if the members at the end are not statically
used.
====

  *** If any buffer access in a given SPIR-V block is determined to be out
      of bounds, then any other access of the same type (load, store, or
      atomic) in the same SPIR-V block that accesses an address less than 16
      bytes away from the out of bounds address may: also be considered out
      of bounds.
  ** Out-of-bounds buffer loads will return any of the following values:
  *** Values from anywhere within the memory range(s) bound to the buffer
      (possibly including bytes of memory past the end of the buffer, up to
      the end of the bound range).
  *** Zero values, or [eq]#(0,0,0,x)# vectors for vector reads where x is a
      valid value represented in the type of the vector components and may:
      be any of:
  **** 0, 1, or the maximum representable positive integer value, for signed
       or unsigned integer components
  **** 0.0 or 1.0, for floating-point components
  ** Out-of-bounds writes may: modify values within the memory range(s)
     bound to the buffer, but must: not modify any other memory.
  ** Out-of-bounds atomics may: modify values within the memory range(s)
     bound to the buffer, but must: not modify any other memory, and return
     an undefined value.
  ** Vertex input attributes are considered out of bounds if the offset of
     the attribute in the bound vertex buffer range plus the size of the
     attribute is greater than either:
+
  *** code:vertexBufferRangeSize, if [eq]#code:bindingStride == 0#; or
  *** [eq]#(code:vertexBufferRangeSize - (code:vertexBufferRangeSize %
      code:bindingStride))#
+
where code:vertexBufferRangeSize is the byte size of the memory range bound
to the vertex buffer binding and code:bindingStride is the byte stride of
the corresponding vertex input binding.
Further, if any vertex input attribute using a specific vertex input binding
is out of bounds, then all vertex input attributes using that vertex input
binding for that vertex shader invocation are considered out of bounds.
  *** If a vertex input attribute is out of bounds, it will be assigned one
      of the following values:
  **** Values from anywhere within the memory range(s) bound to the buffer,
     converted according to the format of the attribute.
  **** Zero values, format converted according to the format of the
       attribute.
  **** Zero values, or [eq]#(0,0,0,x)# vectors, as described above.
  ** If pname:robustBufferAccess is not enabled, out of bounds accesses may:
     corrupt any memory within the process and cause undefined behavior up
     to and including application termination.
  * [[features-features-fullDrawIndexUint32]] pname:fullDrawIndexUint32

  * [[features-features-occlusionQueryPrecise]] pname:occlusionQueryPrecise
    indicates whether occlusion queries returning actual sample counts are
    supported.
    Occlusion queries are created in a sname:VkQueryPool by specifying the

    If this feature is enabled, queries of this type can: enable
    ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT in the pname:flags parameter to
    fname:vkCmdBeginQuery.
    If this feature is not supported, the implementation supports only
    boolean occlusion queries.
    When any samples are passed, boolean queries will return a non-zero
    result value, otherwise a result value of zero is returned.
    When this feature is enabled and ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT is
    set, occlusion queries will report the actual number of samples passed.
  * [[features-features-pipelineStatisticsQuery]]

  * [[features-features-fragmentStoresAndAtomics]]
    pname:fragmentStoresAndAtomics indicates whether storage buffers and
    images support stores and atomic operations in the fragment shader
    stage.
    If this feature is not enabled, all storage image, storage texel

    code:PointSize built-in decoration must: not be read from or written to
    and all points written from a tessellation or geometry shader will have
    a size of 1.0.
    This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
    code:TessellationPointSize capability for tessellation control and
    evaluation shaders, or if the shader modules can: declare the
    code:GeometryPointSize capability for geometry shaders.
    An implementation supporting this feature must: also support one or both

If the format is a depth/stencil format, this bit only indicates that the
depth aspect (not the stencil aspect) of an image of this format supports
min/max filtering, and that min/max filtering of the depth aspect is
supported when depth compare is disabled in the sampler.

The following table specifies the required: minimum/maximum for all Vulkan
graphics implementations.
Where a limit corresponds to a fine-grained device feature which is
optional:, the feature name is listed with two required: limits, one when
the feature is supported and one when it is not supported.
If an implementation supports a feature, the limits reported are the same
whether or not the feature is enabled.

1::
    The *Limit Type* column indicates the limit is either the minimum limit
    all implementations must: support or the maximum limit all
    implementations must: support.
    For bitmasks a minimum limit is the least bits all implementations must:
    set, but they may: have additional bits set beyond this minimum.

2::
    The pname:maxPerStageResources must: be at least the smallest of the
    following:
+
  * the sum of the pname:maxPerStageDescriptorUniformBuffers,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageBuffers,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorSampledImages,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageImages,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorInputAttachments, pname:maxColorAttachments
    limits, or
  * 128.
+
It may: not be possible to reach this limit in every stage.

3::
    See
    <<features-limits-maxViewportDimensions,pname:maxViewportDimensions>>
    for the required: relationship to other limits.

4::
    See <<features-limits-viewportboundsrange,pname:viewportBoundsRange>>
    for the required: relationship to other limits.

5::
    The values pname:minInterpolationOffset and pname:maxInterpolationOffset
    describe the closed interval of supported interpolation offsets:
    [pname:minInterpolationOffset, pname:maxInterpolationOffset].
    The ULP is determined by pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits.
    If pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits is 4, this provides increments
    of (1/2^4^) = 0.0625, and thus the range of supported interpolation
    offsets would be [eq]#[-0.5, 0.4375]#.

6::
    The point size ULP is determined by pname:pointSizeGranularity.
    If the pname:pointSizeGranularity is 0.125, the range of supported point
    sizes must: be at least [1.0, 63.875].

7::
    The line width ULP is determined by pname:lineWidthGranularity.
    If the pname:lineWidthGranularity is 0.0625, the range of supported line
    widths must: be at least [1.0, 7.9375].

8:: The ptext:maxDescriptorSet* limit is _n_ times the corresponding
    ptext:maxPerStageDescriptor* limit, where _n_ is the number of shader
    stages supported by the VkPhysicalDevice.
    If all shader stages are supported, _n_ = 6 (vertex, tessellation
    control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, fragment, compute).

== Additional Multisampling Capabilities

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT',desc='Report sample count specific multisampling capabilities of a physical device',type='protos']
--

In addition to the minimum capabilities described in the previous section
(<<features-limits,Limits>>), implementations may: support additional
multisampling capabilities specific to a particular sample count.

To query additional sample count specific multisampling capabilities, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    additional multisampling capabilities.
  * pname:samples is the sample count to query the capabilities for.
  * pname:pMultisampleProperties is a pointer to a structure of type
    slink:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT, in which information about the
    additional multisampling capabilities specific to the sample count is
    returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT',desc='Structure returning information about sample count specific additional multisampling capabilities',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT structure is defined as

include::../api/structs/VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize is the maximum size of the pixel grid in
    which sample locations can: vary.

include::../validity/structs/VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]
--

If the sample count for which additional multisampling capabilities are
requested using fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT is set
in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSampleLocationsEXT::
<<features-limits-sampleLocationSampleCounts,
pname:sampleLocationSampleCounts>> the pname:width and pname:height members
of sname:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT::pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize must:
be greater than or equal to the corresponding members of
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSampleLocationsEXT::
<<features-limits-maxSampleLocationGridSize,pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize>>,
respectively, otherwise both members must: be `0`.

==== Identification of Formats

A "`format`" is represented by a single enum value.
The name of a format is usually built up by using the following pattern:

    VK_FORMAT_{component-format|compression-scheme}_{numeric-format}

The component-format specifies either the size of the R, G, B, and A
components (if they are present) in the case of a color format, or the size
of the depth (D) and stencil (S) components (if they are present) in the
case of a depth/stencil format (see below).
An X indicates a component that is unused, but may: be present for padding.

.Interpretation of Numeric Format
[width="95%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|====
| Numeric format | Description
| etext:UNORM    | The components are unsigned normalized values in the range [eq]#[0,1]#
| etext:SNORM    | The components are signed normalized values in the range [eq]#[-1,1]#
| etext:USCALED  | The components are unsigned integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SSCALED  | The components are signed integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UINT     | The components are unsigned integer values in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SINT     | The components are signed integer values in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UFLOAT   | The components are unsigned floating-point numbers (used by packed, shared exponent, and some compressed formats)
| etext:SFLOAT   | The components are signed floating-point numbers
| etext:SRGB     | The R, G, and B components are unsigned normalized values that represent values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A component (if one exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
|====

The suffix etext:_PACKnn indicates that the format is packed into an
underlying type with nn bits.
ifdef::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]
The suffix etext:_mPACKnn is a short-hand that indicates that the format has
several components (which may or may not be stored in separate _planes_)
that are each packed into an underlying type with nn bits.
endif::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]

The suffix etext:_BLOCK indicates that the format is a block-compressed
format, with the representation of multiple pixels encoded interdependently
within a region.

[[features-formats-compressionscheme]]
.Interpretation of Compression Scheme
[width="95%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|====
| Compression scheme | Description
| etext:BC           | Block Compression. See <<appendix-compressedtex-bc>>.

ifdef::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]
For _multi-planar_ images, the components in separate _planes_ are separated
by underscores, and the number of planes is indicated by the addition of a
etext:_2PLANE or etext:_3PLANE suffix.
Similarly, the separate aspects of depth-stencil formats are separated by
underscores, although these are not considered separate planes.
Formats are suffixed by etext:_422 to indicate that planes other than the
first are reduced in size by a factor of two horizontally or that the R and
B values appear at half the horizontal frequency of the G values, etext:_420
to indicate that planes other than the first are reduced in size by a factor
of two both horizontally and vertically, and etext:_444 for consistency to
indicate that all three planes of a three-planar image are the same size.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
No common format has a single plane containing both R and B channels but
does not store these channels at reduced horizontal resolution.
====
endif::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]


==== Representation

Color formats must: be represented in memory in exactly the form indicated
by the format's name.
This means that promoting one format to another with more bits per component
and/or additional components must: not occur for color formats.
Depth/stencil formats have more relaxed requirements as discussed
<<features-formats-depth-stencil,below>>.
Each format has an _element size_, the number of bytes used to stored one
element or one compressed block, with the value of the element size listed
in slink:VkFormat.

The representation of non-packed formats is that the first component
specified in the name of the format is in the lowest memory addresses and
the last component specified is in the highest memory addresses.
See <<features-formats-non-packed,Byte mappings for non-packed/compressed
color formats>>.
The in-memory ordering of bytes within a component is determined by the host
endianness.

Packed formats store multiple components within one underlying type.
The bit representation is that the first component specified in the name of
the format is in the most-significant bits and the last component specified
is in the least-significant bits of the underlying type.
The in-memory ordering of bytes comprising the underlying type is determined
by the host endianness.

[[features-formats-depth-stencil]]
==== Depth/Stencil Formats

Depth/stencil formats are considered opaque and need not be stored in the
exact number of bits per texel or component ordering indicated by the format
enum.
However, implementations must: not substitute a different depth or stencil
precision than that described in the format (e.g. D16 must: not be
implemented as D24 or D32).


[[features-formats-compatibility-classes]]
==== Format Compatibility Classes

Uncompressed color formats are _compatible_ with each other if they occupy
the same number of bits per data element.
Compressed color formats are compatible with each other if the only
difference between them is the numerical type of the uncompressed pixels
(e.g. signed vs.
unsigned, or SRGB vs.
UNORM encoding).
Each depth/stencil format is only compatible with itself.
In the <<features-formats-compatibility,following>> table, all the formats
in the same row are compatible.

The following bits may: be set in pname:linearTilingFeatures and
pname:optimalTilingFeatures, specifying that the features are supported by
<<VkImage,images>> or <<VkImageView,image views>> created with the queried
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties::pname:format:

  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT specifies that an image view
    can: be <<descriptorsets-sampledimage, sampled from>>.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT specifies that an image view
    can: be used as a <<descriptorsets-storageimage, storage images>>.

    view can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment and as an input
    attachment.

    image view can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment that supports
    blending and as an input attachment.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT specifies that an
    image view can: be used as a framebuffer depth/stencil attachment and as
    an input attachment.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT specifies that an image can: be
    used as pname:srcImage for the fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_DST_BIT specifies that an image can: be
    used as pname:dstImage for the fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT specifies that
    if ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT is also set, an image view
    can: be used with a sampler that has either of pname:magFilter or
    pname:minFilter set to ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR, or pname:mipmapMode set
    to ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR.
    If ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT is also set, an image can be
    used as the pname:srcImage to flink:vkCmdBlitImage with a pname:filter
    of ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR.
    This bit must: only be exposed for formats that also support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT or
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT.

If the format being queried is a depth/stencil format, this bit only
indicates that the depth aspect (not the stencil aspect) of an image of this
format supports linear filtering, and that linear filtering of the depth
aspect is supported whether depth compare is enabled in the sampler or not.
If this bit is not present, linear filtering with depth compare disabled is
unsupported and linear filtering with depth compare enabled is supported,
but may: compute the filtered value in an implementation-dependent manner
which differs from the normal rules of linear filtering.
The resulting value must: be in the range [eq]#[0,1]# and should: be
proportional to, or a weighted average of, the number of comparison passes
or failures.

    If a format does not incorporate chroma downsampling (it is not a
    "`422`" or "`420`" format) but the implementation supports sampler
    Y'C~B~C~R~ conversion for this format, the implementation must: set
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_MIDPOINT_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT_KHR.

device, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2KHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    format properties.
  * pname:format is the format whose properties are queried.
  * pname:pFormatProperties is a pointer to a slink:VkFormatProperties2KHR
    structure in which physical device properties for pname:format are
    returned.

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2KHR behaves similarly to
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties, with the ability to return
extended information in a pname:pNext chain of output structures.

=== Required Format Support

Implementations must: support at least the following set of features on the
listed formats.
For images, these features must: be supported for every elink:VkImageType
(including arrayed and cube variants) unless otherwise noted.
These features are supported on existing formats without needing to
advertise an extension or needing to explicitly enable them.
Support for additional functionality beyond the requirements listed here is
queried using the flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties command.

The following tables show which feature bits must: be supported for each
format.
ifdef::VK_KHR_maintenance1[]
Formats that are required to support
ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT must: also support
ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT_KHR and

== Additional Image Capabilities

In addition to the minimum capabilities described in the previous sections
(<<features-limits,Limits>> and <<features-formats,Formats>>),
implementations may: support additional capabilities for certain types of
images.
For example, larger dimensions or additional sample counts for certain image
types, or additional capabilities for _linear_ tiling format images.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties',desc='Lists physical device\'s image format capabilities',type='protos']

To query additional capabilities specific to image types, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    image capabilities.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat value specifying the image format,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:format.
  * pname:type is a elink:VkImageType value specifying the image type,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:imageType.
  * pname:tiling is a elink:VkImageTiling value specifying the image tiling,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:tiling.
  * pname:usage is a bitmask of elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits specifying the
    intended usage of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:usage.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkImageCreateFlagBits specifying
    additional parameters of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:flags.
  * pname:pImageFormatProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkImageFormatProperties structure in which capabilities are
    returned.

The pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags
parameters correspond to parameters that would be consumed by
flink:vkCreateImage (as members of sname:VkImageCreateInfo).

If pname:format is not a supported image format, or if the combination of
pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags is not
supported for images, then fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
returns ename:VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED.

The limitations on an image format that are reported by
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties have the following property:
if code:usage1 and code:usage2 of type elink:VkImageUsageFlags are such that
the bits set in code:usage1 are a subset of the bits set in code:usage2, and
code:flags1 and code:flags2 of type elink:VkImageCreateFlags are such that
the bits set in code:flags1 are a subset of the bits set in code:flags2,
then the limitations for code:usage1 and code:flags1 must: be no more strict
than the limitations for code:usage2 and code:flags2, for all values of
pname:format, pname:type, and pname:tiling.

The sname:VkImageFormatProperties structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:maxExtent are the maximum image dimensions.
    See the <<features-extentperimagetype,Allowed Extent Values>> section
    below for how these values are constrained by pname:type.
  * pname:maxMipLevels is the maximum number of mipmap levels.
    pname:maxMipLevels must: either be equal to 1 (valid only if
    pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR) or be equal to
    [eq]#{lceil}log~2~(max(pname:width, pname:height, pname:depth)){rceil}
    {plus} 1#.
    [eq]#pname:width#, [eq]#pname:height#, and [eq]#pname:depth# are taken
    from the corresponding members of pname:maxExtent.
  * pname:maxArrayLayers is the maximum number of array layers.
    pname:maxArrayLayers must: either be equal to 1 or be greater than or
    equal to the pname:maxImageArrayLayers member of
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.
    A value of 1 is valid only if pname:tiling is
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR or if pname:type is ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D.
  * pname:sampleCounts is a bitmask of elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits
    specifying all the supported sample counts for this image as described
    <<features-supported-sample-counts, below>>.
  * pname:maxResourceSize is an upper bound on the total image size in
    bytes, inclusive of all image subresources.
    Implementations may: have an address space limit on total size of a
    resource, which is advertised by this property.
    pname:maxResourceSize must: be at least 2^31^.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no mechanism to query the size of an image before creating it, to
compare that size against pname:maxResourceSize.
If an application attempts to create an image that exceeds this limit, the
creation will fail or the image will be invalid.
While the advertised limit must: be at least 2^31^, it may: not be possible
to create an image that approaches that size, particularly for
ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_1D.
====

If the combination of parameters to
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties is not supported by the
implementation for use in flink:vkCreateImage, then all members of
sname:VkImageFormatProperties will be filled with zero.

[[features-supported-sample-counts]]
=== Supported Sample Counts
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties returns a bitmask of
elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits in pname:sampleCounts specifying the supported
sample counts for the image parameters.

pname:sampleCounts will be set to ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT if at least
one of the following conditions is true:

 * pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR
 * pname:type is not ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D
 * pname:flags contains ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CUBE_COMPATIBLE_BIT
 * Neither the ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT flag nor the
   ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT flag in
   sname:VkFormatProperties::pname:optimalTilingFeatures returned by
   flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties is set

Otherwise, the bits set in pname:sampleCounts will be the sample counts
supported for the specified values of pname:usage and pname:format.
For each bit set in pname:usage, the supported sample counts relate to the
limits in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits as follows:

 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT and
   pname:format is a floating- or fixed-point color format, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferColorSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes
   ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, and pname:format
   includes a depth aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferDepthSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes
   ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, and pname:format
   includes a stencil aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferStencilSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format includes a color aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageColorSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format includes a depth aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageDepthSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format is an integer format, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageIntegerSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:storageImageSampleCounts

If multiple bits are set in pname:usage, pname:sampleCounts will be the
intersection of the per-usage values described above.

If none of the bits described above are set in pname:usage, then there is no
corresponding limit in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.
In this case, pname:sampleCounts must: include at least
ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT.
