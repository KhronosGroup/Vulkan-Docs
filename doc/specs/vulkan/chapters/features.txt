[[features]]
= Features, Limits, and Formats

Vulkan is designed to support a wide range of hardware and as such there are
a number of features, limits, and formats which are not supported on all
hardware.
Features describe functionality that is not required: and which must: be
explicitly enabled.
Limits describe implementation-dependent minimums, maximums, and other
device characteristics that an application may: need to be aware of.
Supported buffer and image formats may: vary across implementations.
A minimum set of format features are guaranteed, but others must: be
explicitly queried before use to ensure they are supported by the
implementation.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The features and limits are reported via basic structures (that is
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures and slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits), as well as
extensible structures (sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR and
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR) which were added in
`<<VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2>>`.
When new features or limits are added in future Vulkan version or
extensions, each extension should: introduce one new feature structure
and/or limit structure (as needed).
These structures can: be added to the pname:pNext chain of the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR and sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR
structures, respectively.
====

[[features-features]]
== Features

The Specification defines a set of fine-grained features that are not
required:, but may: be supported by a Vulkan implementation.
Support for features is reported and enabled on a per-feature basis.
Features are properties of the physical device.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures',desc='Reports capabilities of a physical device',type='protos']
--

To query supported features, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    structure in which the physical device features are returned.
    For each feature, a value of ename:VK_TRUE indicates that the feature is
    supported on this physical device, and ename:VK_FALSE indicates that the
    feature is not supported.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]
--

Fine-grained features used by a logical device must: be enabled at
sname:VkDevice creation time.
If a feature is enabled that the physical device does not support,
sname:VkDevice creation will fail.
If an application uses a feature without enabling it at sname:VkDevice
creation time, the device behavior is undefined.
The validation layer will warn if features are used without being enabled.

The fine-grained features are enabled by passing a pointer to the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure via the pname:pEnabledFeatures
member of the sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure that is passed into the
fname:vkCreateDevice call.
If a member of pname:pEnabledFeatures is set to ename:VK_TRUE or
ename:VK_FALSE, then the device will be created with the indicated feature
enabled or disabled, respectively.
ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
Features can: also be enabled by using the
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure.
endif::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

If an application wishes to enable all features supported by a device, it
can: simply pass in the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure that was
previously returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.
To disable an individual feature, the application can: set the desired
member to ename:VK_FALSE in the same structure.
Setting pname:pEnabledFeatures to `NULL`
ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
and not including a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR in the pname:pNext
member of slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo
endif::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]
is equivalent to setting all members of the structure to ename:VK_FALSE.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Some features, such as pname:robustBufferAccess, may: incur a run-time
performance cost.
Application writers should: carefully consider the implications of enabling
all supported features.
====

ifdef::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR',desc='Reports capabilities of a physical device',type='protos']
--

To query supported features defined by the core or extensions, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR
    structure in which the physical device features are returned.

Each structure in pname:pFeatures and its pname:pNext chain contain members
corresponding to fine-grained features.
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR writes each member to a boolean value
indicating whether that feature is supported.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR',desc='Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR.txt[]

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR structure is defined as:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:features is a structure of type slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    describing the fine-grained features of the Vulkan 1.0 API.

The pname:pNext chain of this structure is used to extend the structure with
features defined by extensions.
This structure can: be used in flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR or can:
be in the pname:pNext chain of a slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure, in
which case it controls which features are enabled in the device in lieu of
pname:pEnabledFeatures.

endif::VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2[]

[open,refpage='VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures',desc='Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure describe the
following features:

  * [[features-features-robustBufferAccess]] pname:robustBufferAccess
    indicates that accesses to buffers are bounds-checked against the range
    of the buffer descriptor (as determined by
    sname:VkDescriptorBufferInfo::pname:range,
    sname:VkBufferViewCreateInfo::pname:range, or the size of the buffer).
    Out of bounds accesses must: not cause application termination, and the
    effects of shader loads, stores, and atomics must: conform to an
    implementation-dependent behavior as described below.
  ** A buffer access is considered to be out of bounds if any of the
     following are true:
  *** The pointer was formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the coordinate
      is less than zero or greater than or equal to the number of whole
      elements in the bound range.
  *** The pointer was not formed by code:OpImageTexelPointer and the object
      pointed to is not wholly contained within the bound range.
ifdef::VK_KHR_variable_pointers[]
      This includes accesses performed via _variable pointers_ where the
      buffer descriptor being accessed cannot be statically determined.
      Uninitialized pointers and pointers equal to code:OpConstantNull are
      treated as pointing to a zero-sized object, so all accesses through
      such pointers are considered to be out of bounds.
endif::VK_KHR_variable_pointers[]
+
[NOTE]
.Note
====
If a SPIR-V code:OpLoad instruction loads a structure and the tail end of
the structure is out of bounds, then all members of the structure are
considered out of bounds even if the members at the end are not statically
used.
====

  *** If any buffer access in a given SPIR-V block is determined to be out
      of bounds, then any other access of the same type (load, store, or
      atomic) in the same SPIR-V block that accesses an address less than 16
      bytes away from the out of bounds address may: also be considered out
      of bounds.
  ** Out-of-bounds buffer loads will return any of the following values:
  *** Values from anywhere within the memory range(s) bound to the buffer
      (possibly including bytes of memory past the end of the buffer, up to
      the end of the bound range).
  *** Zero values, or [eq]#(0,0,0,x)# vectors for vector reads where x is a
      valid value represented in the type of the vector components and may:
      be any of:
  **** 0, 1, or the maximum representable positive integer value, for signed
       or unsigned integer components
  **** 0.0 or 1.0, for floating-point components
  ** Out-of-bounds writes may: modify values within the memory range(s)
     bound to the buffer, but must: not modify any other memory.
  ** Out-of-bounds atomics may: modify values within the memory range(s)
     bound to the buffer, but must: not modify any other memory, and return
     an undefined value.
  ** Vertex input attributes are considered out of bounds if the offset of
     the attribute in the bound vertex buffer range plus the size of the
     attribute is greater than either:
+
  *** code:vertexBufferRangeSize, if [eq]#code:bindingStride == 0#; or
  *** [eq]#(code:vertexBufferRangeSize - (code:vertexBufferRangeSize %
      code:bindingStride))#
+
where code:vertexBufferRangeSize is the byte size of the memory range bound
to the vertex buffer binding and code:bindingStride is the byte stride of
the corresponding vertex input binding.
Further, if any vertex input attribute using a specific vertex input binding
is out of bounds, then all vertex input attributes using that vertex input
binding for that vertex shader invocation are considered out of bounds.
  *** If a vertex input attribute is out of bounds, it will be assigned one
      of the following values:
  **** Values from anywhere within the memory range(s) bound to the buffer,
     converted according to the format of the attribute.
  **** Zero values, format converted according to the format of the
       attribute.
  **** Zero values, or [eq]#(0,0,0,x)# vectors, as described above.
  ** If pname:robustBufferAccess is not enabled, out of bounds accesses may:
     corrupt any memory within the process and cause undefined behavior up
     to and including application termination.
  * [[features-features-fullDrawIndexUint32]] pname:fullDrawIndexUint32

  * [[features-features-occlusionQueryPrecise]] pname:occlusionQueryPrecise
    indicates whether occlusion queries returning actual sample counts are
    supported.
    Occlusion queries are created in a sname:VkQueryPool by specifying the

    fname:vkCreateQueryPool.
    If this feature is enabled, queries of this type can: enable
    ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT in the pname:flags parameter to
    fname:vkCmdBeginQuery.
    If this feature is not supported, the implementation supports only
    boolean occlusion queries.
    When any samples are passed, boolean queries will return a non-zero
    result value, otherwise a result value of zero is returned.
    When this feature is enabled and ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT is
    set, occlusion queries will report the actual number of samples passed.
  * [[features-features-pipelineStatisticsQuery]]

  * [[features-features-fragmentStoresAndAtomics]]
    pname:fragmentStoresAndAtomics indicates whether storage buffers and
    images support stores and atomic operations in the fragment shader
    stage.
    If this feature is not enabled, all storage image, storage texel

    code:PointSize built-in decoration must: not be read from or written to
    and all points written from a tessellation or geometry shader will have
    a size of 1.0.
    This also indicates whether shader modules can: declare the
    code:TessellationPointSize capability for tessellation control and
    evaluation shaders, or if the shader modules can: declare the
    code:GeometryPointSize capability for geometry shaders.
    An implementation supporting this feature must: also support one or both

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSamplerFilterMinmaxPropertiesEXT

    pname:filterMinmaxSingleComponentFormats is a boolean value indicating

The members of the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceConservativeRasterizationPropertiesEXT structure
describe the following implementation-dependent limits:

  * [[features-limits-primitiveOverestimationSize]]
    pname:primitiveOverestimationSize is the size in pixels the generating
    primitive is increased at each of its edges during conservative
    rasterization overestimation mode.
    Even with a size of 0.0, conservative rasterization overestimation rules
    still apply and if any part of the pixel rectangle is covered by the
    generating primitive, fragments are generated for the entire pixel.
    However implementations may: make the pixel coverage area even more
    conservative by increasing the size of the generating primitive.

  * [[features-limits-maxExtraPrimitiveOverestimationSize]]
    pname:maxExtraPrimitiveOverestimationSize is the maximum size in pixels
    of extra overestimation the implementation supports in the pipeline
    state.
    A value of 0.0 means the implementation does not support any additional
    overestimation of the generating primitive during conservative
    rasterization.
    A value above 0.0 allows the application to further increase the size of
    the generating primitive during conservative rasterization
    overestimation.

  * [[features-limits-extraPrimitiveOverestimationSizeGranularity]]
    pname:extraPrimitiveOverestimationSizeGranularity is the granularity of
    extra overestimation that can be specified in the pipeline state between
    0.0 and pname:maxExtraPrimitiveOverestimationSize inclusive.
    A value of 0.0 means the implementation can use the smallest
    representable non-zero value in the screen space pixel fixed-point grid.

  * [[features-limits-primitiveUnderestimation]]
    pname:primitiveUnderestimation is true if the implementation supports
    the ename:VK_CONSERVATIVE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_UNDERESTIMATE_EXT
    conservative rasterization mode in addition to
    ename:VK_CONSERVATIVE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_OVERESTIMATE_EXT.
    Otherwise the implementation only supports
    ename:VK_CONSERVATIVE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_OVERESTIMATE_EXT.

  * [[features-limits-conservativePointAndLineRasterization]]
    pname:conservativePointAndLineRasterization is true if the
    implementation supports conservative rasterization of point and line
    primitives as well as triangle primitives.
    Otherwise the implementation only supports triangle primitives.

  * [[features-limits-degenerateTrianglesRasterized]]
    pname:degenerateTrianglesRasterized is false if the implementation culls
    primitives generated from triangles that become zero area after they are
    quantized to the fixed-point rasterization pixel grid.
    pname:degenerateTrianglesRasterized is true if these primitives are not
    culled and the provoking vertex attributes and depth value are used for
    the fragments.
    The primitive area calculation is done on the primitive generated from
    the clipped triangle if applicable.
    Zero area primitives are backfacing and the application can: enable
    backface culling if desired.

  * [[features-limits-degenerateLinesRasterized]]
    pname:degenerateLinesRasterized is false if the implementation culls
    lines that become zero length after they are quantized to the
    fixed-point rasterization pixel grid.
    pname:degenerateLinesRasterized is true if zero length lines are not
    culled and the provoking vertex attributes and depth value are used for
    the fragments.

  * [[features-limits-fullyCoveredFragmentShaderInputVariable]]
    pname:fullyCoveredFragmentShaderInputVariable is true if the
    implementation supports the SPIR-V builtin fragment shader input
    variable FullyCoveredEXT which indicates that conservative rasterization
    is enabled and the fragment pixel square is fully covered by the
    generating primitive.

  * [[features-limits-conservativeRasterizationPostDepthCoverage]]
ifdef::VK_EXT_post_depth_coverage[]
    pname:conservativeRasterizationPostDepthCoverage is true if the
    implementation supports conservative rasterization with the
    <<shaders-fragment-earlytest-postdepthcoverage,code:PostDepthCoverage>>
    execution mode enabled.
    When supported the code:SampleMask built-in input variable will reflect
    the coverage after the early per-fragment depth and stencil tests are
    applied even when conservative rasterization is enabled.
    Otherwise
    <<shaders-fragment-earlytest-postdepthcoverage,code:PostDepthCoverage>>
    execution mode must: not be used when conservative rasterization is
    enabled.

1::
    The *Limit Type* column indicates the limit is either the minimum limit
    all implementations must: support or the maximum limit all
    implementations must: support.
    For bitmasks a minimum limit is the least bits all implementations must:
    set, but they may: have additional bits set beyond this minimum.

2::
    The pname:maxPerStageResources must: be at least the smallest of the
    following:
+
  * the sum of the pname:maxPerStageDescriptorUniformBuffers,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageBuffers,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorSampledImages,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageImages,
    pname:maxPerStageDescriptorInputAttachments, pname:maxColorAttachments
    limits, or
  * 128.
+
It may: not be possible to reach this limit in every stage.

3::
    See
    <<features-limits-maxViewportDimensions,pname:maxViewportDimensions>>
    for the required: relationship to other limits.

4::
    See <<features-limits-viewportboundsrange,pname:viewportBoundsRange>>
    for the required: relationship to other limits.

5::
    The values pname:minInterpolationOffset and pname:maxInterpolationOffset
    describe the closed interval of supported interpolation offsets:
    [pname:minInterpolationOffset, pname:maxInterpolationOffset].
    The ULP is determined by pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits.
    If pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits is 4, this provides increments
    of (1/2^4^) = 0.0625, and thus the range of supported interpolation
    offsets would be [eq]#[-0.5, 0.4375]#.

6::
    The point size ULP is determined by pname:pointSizeGranularity.
    If the pname:pointSizeGranularity is 0.125, the range of supported point
    sizes must: be at least [1.0, 63.875].

7::
    The line width ULP is determined by pname:lineWidthGranularity.
    If the pname:lineWidthGranularity is 0.0625, the range of supported line
    widths must: be at least [1.0, 7.9375].

8:: The ptext:maxDescriptorSet* limit is _n_ times the corresponding
    ptext:maxPerStageDescriptor* limit, where _n_ is the number of shader
    stages supported by the VkPhysicalDevice.
    If all shader stages are supported, _n_ = 6 (vertex, tessellation
    control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, fragment, compute).

In addition to the minimum capabilities described in the previous section
(<<features-limits,Limits>>), implementations may: support additional
multisampling capabilities specific to a particular sample count.

To query additional sample count specific multisampling capabilities, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    additional multisampling capabilities.
  * pname:samples is the sample count to query the capabilities for.
  * pname:pMultisampleProperties is a pointer to a structure of type
    slink:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT, in which information about the
    additional multisampling capabilities specific to the sample count is
    returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT',desc='Structure returning information about sample count specific additional multisampling capabilities',type='structs']
--

The sname:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT structure is defined as

include::../api/structs/VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize is the maximum size of the pixel grid in
    which sample locations can: vary.

If the sample count for which additional multisampling capabilities are
requested using fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceMultisamplePropertiesEXT is set
in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSampleLocationsEXT::
<<features-limits-sampleLocationSampleCounts,
pname:sampleLocationSampleCounts>> the pname:width and pname:height members
of sname:VkMultisamplePropertiesEXT::pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize must:
be greater than or equal to the corresponding members of
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceSampleLocationsEXT::
<<features-limits-maxSampleLocationGridSize,pname:maxSampleLocationGridSize>>,
respectively, otherwise both members must: be `0`.

==== Identification of Formats

A "`format`" is represented by a single enum value.
The name of a format is usually built up by using the following pattern:

    VK_FORMAT_{component-format|compression-scheme}_{numeric-format}

The component-format specifies either the size of the R, G, B, and A
components (if they are present) in the case of a color format, or the size
of the depth (D) and stencil (S) components (if they are present) in the
case of a depth/stencil format (see below).
An X indicates a component that is unused, but may: be present for padding.

.Interpretation of Numeric Format
[width="95%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|====
| Numeric format | Description
| etext:UNORM    | The components are unsigned normalized values in the range [eq]#[0,1]#
| etext:SNORM    | The components are signed normalized values in the range [eq]#[-1,1]#
| etext:USCALED  | The components are unsigned integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SSCALED  | The components are signed integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UINT     | The components are unsigned integer values in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SINT     | The components are signed integer values in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UFLOAT   | The components are unsigned floating-point numbers (used by packed, shared exponent, and some compressed formats)
| etext:SFLOAT   | The components are signed floating-point numbers
| etext:SRGB     | The R, G, and B components are unsigned normalized values that represent values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A component (if one exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
|====

The suffix etext:_PACKnn indicates that the format is packed into an
underlying type with nn bits.
ifdef::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]
The suffix etext:_mPACKnn is a short-hand that indicates that the format has
several components (which may or may not be stored in separate _planes_)
that are each packed into an underlying type with nn bits.
endif::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]

The suffix etext:_BLOCK indicates that the format is a block-compressed
format, with the representation of multiple pixels encoded interdependently
within a region.

.Interpretation of Compression Scheme
[width="95%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|====
| Compression scheme | Description
| etext:BC           | Block Compression. See <<appendix-compressedtex-bc>>.
| etext:ETC2         | Ericsson Texture Compression. See <<appendix-compressedtex-etc2>>.
| etext:EAC          | ETC2 Alpha Compression. See <<appendix-compressedtex-etc2>>.
| etext:ASTC         | Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (LDR Profile). See <<appendix-compressedtex-astc>>.
|====

ifdef::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]
For _multi-planar_ images, the components in separate _planes_ are separated
by underscores, and the number of planes is indicated by the addition of a
etext:_2PLANE or etext:_3PLANE suffix.
Similarly, the separate aspects of depth-stencil formats are separated by
underscores, although these are not considered separate planes.
Formats are suffixed by etext:_422 to indicate that planes other than the
first are reduced in size by a factor of two horizontally or that the R and
B values appear at half the horizontal frequency of the G values, etext:_420
to indicate that planes other than the first are reduced in size by a factor
of two both horizontally and vertically, and etext:_444 for consistency to
indicate that all three planes of a three-planar image are the same size.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
No common format has a single plane containing both R and B channels but
does not store these channels at reduced horizontal resolution.
====
endif::VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion[]


==== Representation

Color formats must: be represented in memory in exactly the form indicated
by the format's name.
This means that promoting one format to another with more bits per component
and/or additional components must: not occur for color formats.
Depth/stencil formats have more relaxed requirements as discussed
<<features-formats-depth-stencil,below>>.
Each format has an _element size_, the number of bytes used to stored one
element or one compressed block, with the value of the element size listed
in slink:VkFormat.

The representation of non-packed formats is that the first component
specified in the name of the format is in the lowest memory addresses and
the last component specified is in the highest memory addresses.
See <<features-formats-non-packed,Byte mappings for non-packed/compressed
color formats>>.
The in-memory ordering of bytes within a component is determined by the host
endianness.

Packed formats store multiple components within one underlying type.
The bit representation is that the first component specified in the name of
the format is in the most-significant bits and the last component specified
is in the least-significant bits of the underlying type.
The in-memory ordering of bytes comprising the underlying type is determined
by the host endianness.

[[features-formats-depth-stencil]]
==== Depth/Stencil Formats

Depth/stencil formats are considered opaque and need not be stored in the
exact number of bits per texel or component ordering indicated by the format
enum.
However, implementations must: not substitute a different depth or stencil
precision than that described in the format (e.g. D16 must: not be
implemented as D24 or D32).


[[features-formats-compatibility-classes]]
==== Format Compatibility Classes

Uncompressed color formats are _compatible_ with each other if they occupy
the same number of bits per data element.
Compressed color formats are compatible with each other if the only
difference between them is the numerical type of the uncompressed pixels
(e.g. signed vs.
unsigned, or SRGB vs.
UNORM encoding).
Each depth/stencil format is only compatible with itself.
In the <<features-formats-compatibility,following>> table, all the formats
in the same row are compatible.

    image view can: be used as a framebuffer depth/stencil attachment and as
    an input attachment.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT specifies that an image can: be
    used as pname:srcImage for the fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_DST_BIT specifies that an image can: be

  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT specifies that
    if ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT is also set, an image view
    can: be used with a sampler that has either of pname:magFilter or
    pname:minFilter set to ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR, or pname:mipmapMode set
    to ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR.
    If ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT is also set, an image can be
    used as the pname:srcImage to flink:vkCmdBlitImage with a pname:filter
    of ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR.
    This bit must: only be exposed for formats that also support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT or
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT.

If the format being queried is a depth/stencil format, this bit only
indicates that the depth aspect (not the stencil aspect) of an image of this
format supports linear filtering, and that linear filtering of the depth
aspect is supported whether depth compare is enabled in the sampler or not.
If this bit is not present, linear filtering with depth compare disabled is
unsupported and linear filtering with depth compare enabled is supported,
but may: compute the filtered value in an implementation-dependent manner
which differs from the normal rules of linear filtering.
The resulting value must: be in the range [eq]#[0,1]# and should: be
proportional to, or a weighted average of, the number of comparison passes
or failures.

    pname:yChromaOffset of ename:VK_CHROMA_LOCATION_MIDPOINT_KHR.
    Otherwise both pname:xChromaOffset and pname:yChromaOffset must: be
    ename:VK_CHROMA_LOCATION_COSITED_EVEN_KHR.
    If a format does not incorporate chroma downsampling (it is not a
    "`422`" or "`420`" format) but the implementation supports sampler
    Y'C~B~C~R~ conversion for this format, the implementation must: set
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_MIDPOINT_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT_KHR.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COSITED_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT_KHR specifies that an
    application can: define a <<samplers-YCbCr-conversion,sampler Y'C~B~C~R~

    Otherwise both pname:xChromaOffset and pname:yChromaOffset must: be
    ename:VK_CHROMA_LOCATION_MIDPOINT_KHR.
    If neither ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COSITED_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT_KHR nor
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_MIDPOINT_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT_KHR is set, the
    application must: not define a <<samplers-YCbCr-conversion,sampler
    Y'C~B~C~R~ conversion>> using this format as a source.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_LINEAR_FILTER_BIT_KHR
    specifies that the format can do linear sampler filtering

    specifies that the format can have different chroma, min, and mag
    filters.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_CHROMA_RECONSTRUCTION_EXPLICIT_BIT_KHR
    specifies that reconstruction is explicit, as described in
    <<textures-chroma-reconstruction>>.
    If this bit is not present, reconstruction is implicit by default.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_CHROMA_RECONSTRUCTION_EXPLICIT_FORCEABLE_BIT_KHR
    specifies that reconstruction can: be forcibly made explicit by setting
    slink:VkSamplerYcbcrConversionCreateInfoKHR::pname:forceExplicitReconstruction
    to ename:VK_TRUE.
  * ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DISJOINT_BIT_KHR specifies that a multi-planar
    image can: have the ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_DISJOINT_BIT_KHR set during
    image creation.
    An implementation must: not set ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DISJOINT_BIT_KHR

=== Required Format Support

Implementations must: support at least the following set of features on the
listed formats.
For images, these features must: be supported for every elink:VkImageType
(including arrayed and cube variants) unless otherwise noted.
These features are supported on existing formats without needing to
advertise an extension or needing to explicitly enable them.
Support for additional functionality beyond the requirements listed here is
queried using the flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties command.

The following tables show which feature bits must: be supported for each
format.

== Additional Image Capabilities

In addition to the minimum capabilities described in the previous sections
(<<features-limits,Limits>> and <<features-formats,Formats>>),
implementations may: support additional capabilities for certain types of
images.
For example, larger dimensions or additional sample counts for certain image
types, or additional capabilities for _linear_ tiling format images.

[open,refpage='vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties',desc='Lists physical device\'s image format capabilities',type='protos']

To query additional capabilities specific to image types, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    image capabilities.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat value specifying the image format,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:format.
  * pname:type is a elink:VkImageType value specifying the image type,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:imageType.
  * pname:tiling is a elink:VkImageTiling value specifying the image tiling,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:tiling.
  * pname:usage is a bitmask of elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits specifying the
    intended usage of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:usage.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkImageCreateFlagBits specifying
    additional parameters of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:flags.
  * pname:pImageFormatProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkImageFormatProperties structure in which capabilities are
    returned.

The pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags
parameters correspond to parameters that would be consumed by
flink:vkCreateImage (as members of sname:VkImageCreateInfo).

If pname:format is not a supported image format, or if the combination of
pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags is not
supported for images, then fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
returns ename:VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED.

The limitations on an image format that are reported by
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties have the following property:
if code:usage1 and code:usage2 of type elink:VkImageUsageFlags are such that
the bits set in code:usage1 are a subset of the bits set in code:usage2, and
code:flags1 and code:flags2 of type elink:VkImageCreateFlags are such that
the bits set in code:flags1 are a subset of the bits set in code:flags2,
then the limitations for code:usage1 and code:flags1 must: be no more strict
than the limitations for code:usage2 and code:flags2, for all values of
pname:format, pname:type, and pname:tiling.

The sname:VkImageFormatProperties structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:maxExtent are the maximum image dimensions.
    See the <<features-extentperimagetype,Allowed Extent Values>> section
    below for how these values are constrained by pname:type.
  * pname:maxMipLevels is the maximum number of mipmap levels.
    pname:maxMipLevels must: either be equal to 1 (valid only if
    pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR) or be equal to
    [eq]#{lceil}log~2~(max(pname:width, pname:height, pname:depth)){rceil}
    {plus} 1#.
    [eq]#pname:width#, [eq]#pname:height#, and [eq]#pname:depth# are taken
    from the corresponding members of pname:maxExtent.
  * pname:maxArrayLayers is the maximum number of array layers.
    pname:maxArrayLayers must: either be equal to 1 or be greater than or
    equal to the pname:maxImageArrayLayers member of
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.
    A value of 1 is valid only if pname:tiling is
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR or if pname:type is ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D.
  * pname:sampleCounts is a bitmask of elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits
    specifying all the supported sample counts for this image as described
    <<features-supported-sample-counts, below>>.
  * pname:maxResourceSize is an upper bound on the total image size in
    bytes, inclusive of all image subresources.
    Implementations may: have an address space limit on total size of a
    resource, which is advertised by this property.
    pname:maxResourceSize must: be at least 2^31^.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no mechanism to query the size of an image before creating it, to
compare that size against pname:maxResourceSize.
If an application attempts to create an image that exceeds this limit, the
creation will fail or the image will be invalid.
While the advertised limit must: be at least 2^31^, it may: not be possible
to create an image that approaches that size, particularly for
ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_1D.
====

If the combination of parameters to
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties is not supported by the
implementation for use in flink:vkCreateImage, then all members of
sname:VkImageFormatProperties will be filled with zero.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Filling sname:VkImageFormatProperties with zero for unsupported formats is
an exception to the usual rule that output structures have undefined
contents on error.
This exception was unintentional, but is preserved for backwards
compatibility.

[[features-supported-sample-counts]]
=== Supported Sample Counts
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties returns a bitmask of
elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits in pname:sampleCounts specifying the supported
sample counts for the image parameters.

pname:sampleCounts will be set to ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT if at least
one of the following conditions is true:

 * pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR
 * pname:type is not ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D
 * pname:flags contains ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CUBE_COMPATIBLE_BIT
 * Neither the ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT flag nor the
   ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT flag in
   sname:VkFormatProperties::pname:optimalTilingFeatures returned by
   flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties is set

Otherwise, the bits set in pname:sampleCounts will be the sample counts
supported for the specified values of pname:usage and pname:format.
For each bit set in pname:usage, the supported sample counts relate to the
limits in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits as follows:

 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT and
   pname:format is a floating- or fixed-point color format, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferColorSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes
   ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, and pname:format
   includes a depth aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferDepthSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes
   ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, and pname:format
   includes a stencil aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:framebufferStencilSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format includes a color aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageColorSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format includes a depth aspect, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageDepthSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, and
   pname:format is an integer format, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sampledImageIntegerSampleCounts
 * If pname:usage includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT, a superset of
   sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:storageImageSampleCounts

If multiple bits are set in pname:usage, pname:sampleCounts will be the
intersection of the per-usage values described above.

If none of the bits described above are set in pname:usage, then there is no
corresponding limit in sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.
In this case, pname:sampleCounts must: include at least
ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT.

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalFenceInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPhysicalDeviceExternalFenceInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure
  * pname:pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:handleType is a elink:VkExternalFenceHandleTypeFlagBitsKHR value
    indicating an external fence handle type for which capabilities will be
    returned.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Handles of type ename:VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT_KHR
generated by the implementation may represent either Linux Sync Files or
Android Fences at the implementation's discretion.
Applications should: only use operations defined for both types of file
descriptors, unless they know via means external to Vulkan the type of the
file descriptor, or are prepared to deal with the system-defined operation
failures resulting from using the wrong type.

Bits which may: be set in
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalFenceInfoKHR::pname:handleType, and in the
pname:exportFromImportedHandleTypes and pname:compatibleHandleTypes members
of slink:VkExternalFencePropertiesKHR, to indicate external fence handle
types, are:

include::../api/enums/VkExternalFenceHandleTypeFlagBitsKHR.txt[]

  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_FD_BIT_KHR indicates a POSIX
    file descriptor handle that has only limited valid usage outside of
    Vulkan and other compatible APIs.
    It must: be compatible with the POSIX system calls code:dup, code:dup2,
    code:close, and the non-standard system call code:dup3.
    Additionally, it must: be transportable over a socket using an
    code:SCM_RIGHTS control message.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its Vulkan fence object.
  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_BIT_KHR indicates an NT
    handle that has only limited valid usage outside of Vulkan and other
    compatible APIs.
    It must: be compatible with the functions code:DuplicateHandle,
    code:CloseHandle, code:CompareObjectHandles, code:GetHandleInformation,
    and code:SetHandleInformation.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its Vulkan fence object.
  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KMT_BIT_KHR indicates a
    global share handle that has only limited valid usage outside of Vulkan
    and other compatible APIs.
    It is not compatible with any native APIs.
    It does not own a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its Vulkan fence object, and will therefore become
    invalid when all Vulkan fence objects associated with it are destroyed.
  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT_KHR indicates a POSIX
    file descriptor handle to a Linux Sync File or Android Fence.
    It can be used with any native API accepting a valid sync file or fence
    as input.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    associated with the file descriptor.
    Implementations which support importing this handle type must: accept
    any type of sync or fence FD supported by the native system they are
    running on.

Some external fence handle types can only be shared within the same
underlying physical device and/or the same driver version, as defined in the
