[[features]]
= Features, Limits, and Formats

{apiname} is designed to support a wide range of hardware and as such there
are a number of features, limits, and formats which are not supported on all
hardware. Features describe functionality that is not required: and which
must: be explicitly enabled. Limits describe implementation-dependent
minimums, maximums, and other device characteristics that an application
may: need to be aware of. Supported buffer and image formats may: vary
across implementations. A minimum set of format features are guaranteed, but
others must: be explicitly queried before use to ensure they are supported
by the implementation.


[[features-features]]
== Features

The Specification defines a set of fine-grained features that are not
required:, but may: be supported by a {apiname} implementation. Support for
features is reported and enabled on a per-feature basis. Features are
properties of the physical device.

To query supported features, call:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    supported features.
  * pname:pFeatures is a pointer to a slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures
    structure in which the physical device features are returned. For each
    feature, a value of ename:VK_TRUE indicates that the feature is
    supported on this physical device, and ename:VK_FALSE indicates that the
    feature is not supported.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

Fine-grained features used by a logical device must: be enabled at
sname:VkDevice creation time. If a feature is enabled that the physical
device does not support, sname:VkDevice creation will fail. If an
application uses a feature without enabling it at sname:VkDevice creation
time, the device behaviour is undefined. The validation layer will warn if
features are used without being enabled.

The fine-grained features are enabled by passing a pointer to the
sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure via the pname:pEnabledFeatures
member of the sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure that is passed into the
fname:vkCreateDevice call. If a member of pname:pEnabledFeatures is set to
ename:VK_TRUE or ename:VK_FALSE, then the device will be created with the
indicated feature enabled or disabled, respectively.

If an application wishes to enable all features supported by a device, it
can: simply pass in the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure that was
previously returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures. To disable an
individual feature, the application can: set the desired member to
ename:VK_FALSE in the same structure. To disable all features which are not
required:, set pname:pEnabledFeatures to `NULL`.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Some features, such as pname:robustBufferAccess, may: incur a run-time
performance cost. Application writers should: carefully consider the
implications of enabling all supported features.
====

The definition of sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures is:

include::../structs/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.txt[]

The members of the sname:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure describe the
following features:

  * [[features-features-robustBufferAccess]] pname:robustBufferAccess

      value represented in the type of the vector components and may: be any
      of:
  **** 0, 1, or the maximum representable positive integer value, for signed
       or unsigned integer components
  **** 0.0 or 1.0, for floating-point components
  ** When enabled, out-of-bounds writes may: modify values within the buffer
     object or be ignored.

=== Limit Requirements

The following table specifies the required minimum/maximum for all {apiname}
graphics implementations. Where a limit corresponds to a fine-grained
device feature which is optional:, the feature name is listed with two
required limits, one when the feature is supported and one when it is not
supported. If an implementation supports a feature, the limits reported are
the same whether or not the feature is enabled.

|=============================

1::
    The *Limit Type* column indicates the limit is either the minimum limit all
    implementations must: support or the maximum limit all implementations
    must: support. For bitfields a minimum limit is the least
    bits all implementations must: set, but they may: have
    additional bits set beyond this minimum.

2::
    The pname:maxPerStageResources must: be at least the smallest of the
    following:
+
--
* the sum of the pname:maxPerStageDescriptorUniformBuffers,
  pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageBuffers,
  pname:maxPerStageDescriptorSampledImages,
  pname:maxPerStageDescriptorStorageImages,
  pname:maxPerStageDescriptorInputAttachments, pname:maxColorAttachments
  limits, or
* 128.
--
+
It maynot: be possible to reach this limit in every stage.

3::
    Maximum image attachment size or maximum display size

4::
    Double the pname:maxViewportDimensions

5::
    The values pname:minInterpolationOffset and pname:maxInterpolationOffset
    describe the closed interval of supported interpolation offsets:
    [pname:minInterpolationOffset, pname:maxInterpolationOffset]. The ULP is
    determined by pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits. If
    pname:subPixelInterpolationOffsetBits is 4, this provides increments of
    (1/2^4^) = 0.0625, and thus the range of supported interpolation offsets
    would be [-0.5, 0.4375].

6::
    The point size ULP is determined by pname:pointSizeGranularity. If the
    pname:pointSizeGranularity is 0.125, the range of supported point sizes
    must: be at least [1.0, 63.875].

7::
    The line width ULP is determined by pname:lineWidthGranularity. If the
    pname:lineWidthGranularity is 0.0625, the range of supported line widths
    must: be at least [1.0, 7.9375].

For the purposes of address alignment when accessing buffer memory
containing vertex attribute or texel data, the following formats are
considered _packed_ - whole texels or attributes are stored in a single data
element, rather than individual components occupying a single data element:

==== Identification of Formats

A ``format'' is represented by a single enum value. The name of a format is
usually built up by using the following pattern:

    VK_FORMAT_{component-format|compression-scheme}_{numeric-format}

The component-format specifies either the size of the R, G, B, and A
components (if they are present) in the case of a color format, or the size
of the depth (D) and stencil (S) components (if they are present) in the
case of a depth/stencil format (see below). An X indicates a component that
is unused, but may: be present for padding.

.Interpretation of Numeric Format
[width="95%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|===================
| Numeric format | Description
| etext:UNORM    | The components are unsigned normalized values in the range [0,1]
| etext:SNORM    | The components are signed normalized values in the range [-1,1]
| etext:USCALED  | The components are unsigned integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SSCALED  | The components are signed integer values that get converted to floating-point in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UINT     | The components are unsigned integer values in the range [0,2^n^-1]
| etext:SINT     | The components are signed integer values in the range [-2^n-1^,2^n-1^-1]
| etext:UFLOAT   | The components are unsigned floating-point numbers (used by packed, shared exponent, and some compressed formats)
| etext:SFLOAT   | The components are signed floating-point numbers
| etext:SRGB     | The R, G, and B components are unsigned normalized values that represent values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A component (if one exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
|===================

The suffix etext:_PACKnn indicates that the format is packed into an
underlying type with nn bits.

The suffix etext:_BLOCK indicates that the format is a block compressed
format, with the representation of multiple pixels encoded interdependently
within a region.

==== Representation

Color formats must: be represented in memory in exactly the form indicated
by the format's name. This means that promoting one format to
another with more bits per component and/or additional components
mustnot: occur for color formats. Depth/stencil formats have more relaxed
requirements as discussed <<features-formats-depth-stencil,below>>.

The representation of non-packed formats is that the first component
specified in the name of the format is in the lowest memory addresses and
the last component specified is in the highest memory addresses. See
<<features-formats-non-packed,Byte mappings for non-packed/compressed color
formats>>. The in-memory ordering of bytes within a component is determined
by the host endianness.

Packed formats store multiple components within one underlying type. The bit
representation is that the first component specified in the name of the
format is in the most-significant bits and the last component specified is
in the least-significant bits of the underlying type. The in-memory ordering
of bytes comprising the underlying type is determined by the host
endianness.

[[features-formats-depth-stencil]]
==== Depth/Stencil Formats

Depth/stencil formats are considered opaque and need not
be stored in the exact number of bits per texel or component ordering
indicated by the format enum. However, implementations mustnot: substitute
a different depth or stencil precision than that described in the format
(e.g. D16 mustnot: be implemented as D24 or D32).


[[features-formats-compatibility-classes]]
==== Format Compatibility Classes

Uncompressed color formats are _compatible_ with each other if they occupy
the same number of bits per data element. Compressed color formats are
compatible with each other if the only difference between them is the
numerical type of the uncompressed pixels (e.g. signed vs. unsigned, or
SRGB vs. UNORM encoding). Each depth/stencil format is only compatible
with itself. In the <<features-formats-compatibility,following>> table,
all the formats in the same row are compatible.

=== Format Properties

To query supported format features which are properties of the physical
device, call:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    format properties.
  * pname:format is the format whose properties are queried.
  * pname:pFormatProperties is a pointer to a slink:VkFormatProperties
    structure in which physical device properties for pname:format are
    returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties.txt[]

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties returns sname:VkFormatProperties:

include::../structs/VkFormatProperties.txt[]

The features are described as a set of elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits:

include::../enums/VkFormatFeatureFlagBits.txt[]

The pname:linearTilingFeatures and pname:optimalTilingFeatures members of
the sname:VkFormatProperties structure describe what features are supported
by ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR and ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL images,
respectively.

The following features may: be supported by images or image views created
with pname:format:

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be sampled from. See
    <<descriptorsets-sampledimage, sampled images>> section.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as storage image. See
    <<descriptorsets-storageimage, storage images>> section.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_ATOMIC_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as storage image that supports atomic
    operations.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment and
    as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BLEND_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment that
    supports blending and as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer depth/stencil attachment
    and as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT::
    sname:VkImage can: be used as pname:srcImage for the
    fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_DST_BIT::
    sname:VkImage can: be used as pname:dstImage for the
    fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT::
    sname:VkImage can: be used with a sampler that has either of
    pname:magFilter or pname:minFilter set to ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR,
    or pname:mipmapMode set to ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR. This bit
    must: only be exposed for formats that also support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT. If the format being
    queried is a depth/stencil format, this only indicates that the
    depth aspect is linearly filterable.

The pname:bufferFeatures member of the sname:VkFormatProperties structure
describes what features are supported by buffers.

The following features may: be supported by buffers or buffer views created
with pname:format:

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used to create a sname:VkBufferView that can: be bound to
    a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER descriptor.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used to create a sname:VkBufferView that can: be bound to
    a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER descriptor.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_ATOMIC_BIT::
    Atomic operations are supported on
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER with this format.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used as a vertex attribute format
    (sname:VkVertexInputAttributeDescription.format).

If pname:format is a block-compression format, then buffers mustnot: support
any features for the format.

include::../validity/structs/VkFormatProperties.txt[]


=== Required Format Support

Implementations must: support at least the following set of
features on the listed formats. For images, these features must:
be supported for every slink:VkImageType (including arrayed and cube
variants) unless otherwise noted. These features are supported
on existing formats without needing to advertise an extension or
needing to explicitly enable them. Support for additional functionality
beyond the requirements listed here is queried using the
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties command.

The following tables show which feature bits must: be supported
for each format.

== Additional Image Capabilities

In addition to the minimum capabilities described in the previous sections
(<<features-limits,Limits>> and <<features-formats,Formats>>),
implementations may: support additional capabilities for certain types of
images. For example, larger dimensions or additional sample counts for
certain image types, or additional capabilities for _linear_ tiling format
images.

To query additional capabilities specific to image types, call:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    image capabilities.
  * pname:format is the image format, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo.format.
  * pname:type is the image type, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo.imageType.
  * pname:tiling is the image tiling, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo.tiling.
  * pname:usage is the intended usage of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo.usage.
  * pname:flags is a bitfield describing additional parameters of the image,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo.flags.
  * pname:pImageFormatProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkImageFormatProperties structure in which capabilities are
    returned.

The pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags
parameters correspond to parameters that would be consumed by
flink:vkCreateImage.

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.txt[]

The definition of the sname:VkImageFormatProperties structure is:

include::../structs/VkImageFormatProperties.txt[]

  * pname:maxExtent are the maximum image dimensions. See the
    <<features-extentperimagetype,Allowed extent values based on imageType>>
    table below for how these values are constrained by pname:type.
  * pname:maxMipLevels is the maximum number of mipmap levels.
    pname:maxMipLevels must: either be equal to 1 (valid only if
    pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR) or be greater than or
    equal to the latexmath:[$log_2$] of the pname:maxImageDimension1D,
    pname:maxImageDimension2D, or pname:maxImageDimension3D (depending on
    pname:type) members of slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.
  * pname:maxArrayLayers is the maximum number of array layers.
    pname:maxArrayLayers must: either be equal to 1 or be greater than or
    equal to the pname:maxImageArrayLayers member of
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits. A value of 1 is valid only if pname:tiling
    is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR or if pname:type is
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D.
  * pname:sampleCounts is a bitmask of elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits
    specifying all the supported sample counts for this image. When
    pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR the pname:sampleCounts will
    be set to ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT. Otherwise the bits set here are a
    superset of the corresponding limits for the image type in the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits struct. For non-integer color images this
    is pname:sampledImageColorSampleCounts, for integer format color images
    this is pname:sampledImageIntegerSampleCounts, for depth/stencil images
    with a depth component this is pname:sampledImageDepthSampleCounts, for
    depth/stencil with a stencil component images this is
    pname:sampledImageStencilSampleCounts, and if pname:usage has
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT set this is
    pname:storageImageSampleCounts. For depth/stencil images with both a
    depth and stencil component, both the depth and stencil limits must: be
    satisfied.
  * pname:maxResourceSize is the maximum total image size in bytes,
    inclusive of all subresources. Implementations may: have an address
    space limit on total size of a resource, which is advertised by this
    property. pname:maxResourceSize must: be at least 2^31^.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no mechanism to query the size of an image before creating it, to
compare that size against pname:maxResourceSize. If an application attempts
to create an image that exceeds this limit, the creation will fail or the
image will be invalid.
====

If the combination of parameters to
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties is not supported by the
implementation for use in flink:vkCreateImage, then all members of
sname:VkImageFormatProperties will be filled with zero.

include::../validity/structs/VkImageFormatProperties.txt[]

width >= 1 +
height >= 1 +
depth = 1 +
| VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D |
width >= 1 +
height >= 1 +
depth >= 1 +
|====

If pname:format is not a supported image format, or if the combination of
pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags is not
supported for images, then fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
returns ename:VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED.

The limitations on an image format that are reported by
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties have the following property:
if code:usage1 and code:usage2 of type elink:VkImageUsageFlags and
code:flags1 and code:flags2 of type elink:VkImageCreateFlags are such that
code:usage1 contains a subset of the bits set in code:usage2 and code:flags1
contains a subset of the bits set in code:flags2, then the limitations for
code:usage1 and code:flags1 must: be no more strict than the limitations for
code:usage2 and code:flags2, for all values of pname:format, pname:type, and
pname:tiling.
