[[synchronization]]
= Synchronization and Cache Control

Synchronization of access to resources is primarily the responsibility of
the application in Vulkan.
The order of execution of commands with respect to the host and other
commands on the device has few implicit guarantees, and needs to be
explicitly specified.
Memory caches and other optimizations are also explicitly managed, requiring
that the flow of data through the system is largely under application
control.

Whilst some implicit guarantees exist between commands, four explicit
synchronization primitives are exposed by Vulkan:

<<synchronization-fences,Fences>>::
    Fences can: be used to communicate to the host that execution of some
    task on the device has completed.

<<synchronization-semaphores,Semaphores>>::
    Semaphores can: be used to control resource access across multiple
    queues.

<<synchronization-events,Events>>::
    Events provide a fine-grained synchronization primitive which can: be
    signaled either within a command buffer or by the host, and can: be
    waited upon within a command buffer or queried on the host.

<<synchronization-pipeline-barriers,Pipeline Barriers>>::
    Pipeline barriers also provide synchronization control within a command
    buffer, but at a single point, rather than with separate signal and wait
    operations.

In addition to the base primitives provided here, <<renderpass, Render
Passes>> provide a useful synchronization framework for most rendering
tasks, built upon the concepts in this chapter.
Many cases that would otherwise need an application to use synchronization
primitives in this chapter can: be expressed more efficiently as part of a
render pass.


[[synchronization-dependencies]]
== Execution and Memory Dependencies

An _operation_ is an arbitrary amount of work to be executed on the host, a
device, or an external entity such as a presentation engine.
Synchronization commands introduce explicit _execution dependencies_, and
_memory dependencies_ between two sets of operations defined by the
command's two _synchronization scopes_.

[[synchronization-dependencies-scopes]]
The synchronization scopes define which other operations a synchronization
command is able to create execution dependencies with.
Any type of operation that is not in a synchronization command's
synchronization scopes will not be included in the resulting dependency.
For example, for many synchronization commands, the synchronization scopes
can: be limited to just operations executing in specific
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages,pipeline stages>>, which allows other
pipeline stages to be excluded from a dependency.
Other scoping options are possible, depending on the particular command.

[[synchronization-dependencies-execution]]
An _execution dependency_ is a guarantee that for two sets of operations,
the first set must: _happen-before_ the second set.
If an operation happens-before another operation, then the first operation
must: complete before the second operation is initiated.
More precisely:

  * Let *A* and *B* be separate sets of operations.
  * Let *S* be a synchronization command.
  * Let *A~S~* and *B~S~* be the synchronization scopes of *S*.
  * Let *A'* be the intersection of sets *A* and *A~S~*.
  * Let *B'* be the intersection of sets *B* and *B~S~*.
  * Submitting *A*, *S* and *B* for execution, in that order, will result in
    execution dependency *E* between *A'* and *B'*.
  * Execution dependency *E* guarantees that *A'* happens-before *B'*.

[[synchronization-dependencies-chains]]
An _execution dependency chain_ is a sequence of execution dependencies that
form a happens-before relation between the first dependency's *A'* and the
final dependency's *B'*.
For each consecutive pair of execution dependencies, a chain exists if the
intersection of *B~S~* in the first dependency and *A~S~* in the second
dependency is not an empty set.
The formation of a single execution dependency from an execution dependency
chain can be described by substituting the following in the description of
execution dependencies:

  * Let *S* be a set of synchronization commands that generate an execution
    dependency chain.
  * Let *A~S~* be the first synchronization scope of the first command in
    *S*.
  * Let *B~S~* be the second synchronization scope of the last command in
    *S*.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
An execution dependency is inherently also multiple execution dependencies -
a dependency exists between each subset of *A'* and each subset of *B'*, and
the same is true for execution dependency chains.
For example, a synchronization command with multiple
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages,pipeline stages>> in its stage masks
effectively generates one dependency between each source stage and each
destination stage.
This can be useful to think about when considering how execution chains are
formed if they don't involve all parts of a synchronization command's
dependency.
Similarly, any set of adjacent dependencies in an execution dependency chain
can: be considered an execution dependency chain in its own right.
====

Execution dependencies alone are not sufficient to guarantee that values
resulting from writes in one set of operations can: be read from another set
of operations.

[[synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible]]
Two additional types of operation are used to control memory access.
_Availability operations_ cause the values generated by specified memory
write accesses to become _available_ for future access.
Any available value remains available until a subsequent write to the same
memory location occurs (whether it is made available or not) or the memory
is freed.
_Visibility operations_ cause any available values to become _visible_ to
specified memory accesses.

[[synchronization-dependencies-memory]]
A _memory dependency_ is an execution dependency which includes availability
and visibility operations such that:

  * The first set of operations happens-before the availability operation.
  * The availability operation happens-before the visibility operation.
  * The visibility operation happens-before the second set of operations.

Once written values are made visible to a particular type of memory access,
they can: be read or written by that type of memory access.
Most synchronization commands in Vulkan define a memory dependency.

[[synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes]]
The specific memory accesses that are made available and visible are defined
by the _access scopes_ of a memory dependency.
Any type of access that is in a memory dependency's first access scope and
occurs in *A'* is made available.
Any type of access that is in a memory dependency's second access scope and
occurs in *B'* has any available writes made visible to it.
Any type of operation that is not in a synchronization command's access
scopes will not be included in the resulting dependency.

A memory dependency enforces availability and visibility of memory accesses
and execution order two sets of operations.
Adding to the description of <<synchronization-dependencies-chains,
execution dependency chains>>:

  * Let *a* be the set of memory accesses performed by *A'*.
  * Let *b* be the set of memory accesses performed by *B'*.
  * Let *a~S~* be the first access scope of the first command in *S*.
  * Let *b~S~* be the second access scope of the last command in *S*.
  * Let *a'* be the intersection of sets *a* and *a~S~*.
  * Let *b'* be the intersection of sets *b* and *b~S~*.
  * Submitting *A*, *S* and *B* for execution, in that order, will result in
    a memory dependency *m* between *A'* and *B'*.
  * Memory dependency *m* guarantees that:
  ** Memory writes in *a'* are made available.
  ** Available memory writes, including those from *a'*, are made visible to
     *b'*.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Execution and memory dependencies are used to solve data hazards, i.e. to
ensure that read and write operations occur in a well-defined order.
Write-after-read hazards can be solved with just an execution dependency,
but read-after-write and write-after-write hazards need appropriate memory
dependencies to be included between them.
If an application does not include dependencies to solve these hazards, the
results and execution orders of memory accesses are undefined.
====


[[synchronization-image-layout-transitions]]
=== Image Layout Transitions

Image subresources can: be transitioned from one <<resources-image-layouts,
layout>> to another as part of a <<synchronization-dependencies-memory,
memory dependency>> (e.g. by using an
<<synchronization-image-memory-barriers,image memory barrier>>).
When a layout transition is specified in a memory dependency, it
happens-after the availability operations in the memory dependency, and
happens-before the visibility operations.
Image layout transitions may: perform read and write accesses on all memory
bound to the image subresource range, so applications must: ensure that all
memory writes have been made
<<synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible, available>> before a
layout transition is executed.
Available memory is automatically made visible to a layout transition, and
writes performed by a layout transition are automatically made available.

Layout transitions always apply to a particular image subresource range, and
specify both an old layout and new layout.
If the old layout does not match the new layout, a transition occurs.
The old layout must: match the current layout of the image subresource
range, with one exception.
The old layout can: always be specified as ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED,
though doing so invalidates the contents of the image subresource range.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Setting the old layout to ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED implies that the
contents of the image subresource need not be preserved.
Implementations may: use this information to avoid performing expensive data
transition operations.
====

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Applications must: ensure that layout transitions happen-after all
operations accessing the image with the old layout, and happen-before any
operations that will access the image with the new layout.
Layout transitions are potentially read/write operations, so not defining
appropriate memory dependencies to guarantee this will result in a data
race.
====

The contents of any portion of another resource which aliases memory that is
bound to the transitioned image subresource range are undefined after an
image layout transition.


[[synchronization-pipeline-stages]]
=== Pipeline Stages

The work performed by an <<fundamentals-queueoperation-commandorder, action
command>> consists of multiple operations, which are performed by a sequence
of logically independent execution units known as _pipeline stages_.
The exact pipeline stages executed depend on the particular action command
that is used, and current command buffer state when the action command was
recorded.
<<drawing,Drawing commands>>, <<dispatch,dispatching commands>>,
<<copies,copy commands>>, and <<clears,clear commands>> all execute
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages-types,different sets of pipeline stages>>.

Execution of operations across pipeline stages must: adhere to
<<fundamentals-queueoperation-apiorder, API order>>,
<<fundamentals-queueoperation-commandorder, command order>>, and
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, pipeline stage order>>.
Otherwise, execution across pipeline stages may: overlap or execute out of
order with regards to other stages, unless otherwise enforced by an
execution dependency.

// refBegin VkPipelineStageFlagBits - Bitmask specifying pipeline stages

Several of the <<fundamentals-queueoperation-commandorder, synchronization
commands>> include pipeline stage parameters, restricting the
<<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scopes>> for that
command to those stages.
This allows fine grained control over the exact execution dependencies and
accesses performed by action commands.
Implementations should: use these pipeline stages to avoid unnecessary
stalls or cache flushing.

These pipeline stages are specified using a bitmask:

include::../api/enums/VkPipelineStageFlagBits.txt[]

The meaning of each bit is:

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT: Stage of the pipeline where any
    commands are initially received by the queue.

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT: Stage of the pipeline where
    Draw/DispatchIndirect data structures are consumed.
ifdef::VK_NVX_device_generated_commands[]
    This stage also includes reading commands written by
    flink:vkCmdProcessCommandsNVX.
endif::VK_NVX_device_generated_commands[]
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_INPUT_BIT: Stage of the pipeline where
    vertex and index buffers are consumed.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT: Vertex shader stage.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_BIT: Tessellation
    control shader stage.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_BIT: Tessellation
    evaluation shader stage.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_GEOMETRY_SHADER_BIT: Geometry shader stage.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT: Fragment shader stage.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT: Stage of the pipeline
    where early fragment tests (depth and stencil tests before fragment
    shading) are performed.
    This stage also includes <<renderpass-load-store-ops, subpass load
    operations>> for framebuffer attachments with a depth/stencil format.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT: Stage of the pipeline
    where late fragment tests (depth and stencil tests after fragment
    shading) are performed.
    This stage also includes <<renderpass-load-store-ops, subpass store
    operations>> for framebuffer attachments with a depth/stencil format.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT: Stage of the
    pipeline after blending where the final color values are output from the
    pipeline.
    This stage also includes <<renderpass-load-store-ops, subpass load and
    store operations>> and multisample resolve operations for framebuffer
    attachments with a color format.
  * [[synchronization-pipeline-stages-transfer]]
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT: Execution of copy commands.
    This includes the operations resulting from all <<copies,copy
    commands>>, <<clears,clear commands>> (with the exception of
    flink:vkCmdClearAttachments), and flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COMPUTE_SHADER_BIT: Execution of a compute
    shader.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT: Final stage in the pipeline
    where operations generated by all commands complete execution.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT: A pseudo-stage indicating execution on
    the host of reads/writes of device memory.
    This stage is not invoked by any commands recorded in a command buffer.
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_GRAPHICS_BIT: Execution of all graphics
    pipeline stages.
    Equivalent to the logical or of:

  ** ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT
  ** ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT
  ** ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_INPUT_BIT
  ** ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT: Equivalent to the logical or
    of every other pipeline stage flag that is supported on the queue it is
    used with.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
An execution dependency with only ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT
in the destination stage mask will only prevent that stage from executing in
subsequently submitted commands.
As this stage doesn't perform any actual execution, this is not observable -
in effect, it does not delay processing of subsequent commands.
Similarly an execution dependency with only
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT in the source stage mask will
effectively not wait for any prior commands to complete.

When defining a memory dependency, using only
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT or
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT would never make any accesses
available and/or visible because these stages do not access memory.

ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT and
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT are useful for accomplishing layout
transitions and queue ownership operations when the required execution
dependency is satisfied by other means - for example, semaphore operations
between queues.
====

// refEnd VkPipelineStageFlagBits

[[synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks]]
If a synchronization command includes a source stage mask, its first
<<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>> only includes
execution of the pipeline stages specified in that mask, as well as any
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, logically earlier>> stages.
If a synchronization command includes a destination stage mask, its second
<<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>> only includes
execution of the pipeline stages specified in that mask, as well as any
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages-order, logically later>> stages.

<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, Access scopes>> are affected
in a similar way.
If a synchronization command includes a source stage mask, its first
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> only includes
memory access performed by pipeline stages specified in that mask.
If a synchronization command includes a destination stage mask, its second
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> only includes
memory access performed by pipeline stages specified in that mask.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Implementations may: not support synchronization at every pipeline stage for
every synchronization operation.
If a pipeline stage that an implementation does not support synchronization
for appears in a source stage mask, then it may: substitute that stage for
any logically later stage.
If a pipeline stage that an implementation does not support synchronization
for appears in a destination stage mask, then it may: substitute that stage
for any logically earlier stage.

For example, if an implementation is unable to signal an event immediately
after vertex shader execution is complete, it may: instead signal the event
after color attachment output has completed.

If an implementation makes such a substitution, it must: not affect the
semantics of execution or memory dependencies or image and buffer memory
barriers.
====

Certain pipeline stages are only available on queues that support a
particular set of operations.
The following table lists, for each pipeline stage flag, which queue
capability flag must: be supported by the queue.
When multiple flags are enumerated in the second column of the table, it
means that the pipeline stage is supported on the queue if it supports any
of the listed capability flags.
For further details on queue capabilities see

[[synchronization-pipeline-stages-order]]
Pipeline stages that execute as a result of a command logically complete
execution in a specific order, such that completion of a logically later
pipeline stage must: not happen-before completion of a logically earlier
stage.
This means that including any given stage in the source stage mask for a
particular synchronization command also implies that any logically earlier
stages are included in *A~S~* for that command.

Similarly, initiation of a logically earlier pipeline stage must: not
happen-after initiation of a logically later pipeline stage.
Including any given stage in the destination stage mask for a particular
synchronization command also implies that any logically later stages are
included in *B~S~* for that command.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Logically earlier/later stages are not included when defining the
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scopes>> of a
<<synchronization-memory-barriers,memory barrier>>.
====

[[synchronization-pipeline-stages-types]]
The order of pipeline stages depends on the particular pipeline; graphics,
compute, transfer or host.

For the graphics pipeline, the following stages occur in this order:

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_INPUT_BIT

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT

For host operations, only one pipeline stage occurs, so no order is
guaranteed:

[[synchronization-access-types]]
=== Access Types

Memory in Vulkan can: be accessed from within shader invocations and via
some fixed-function stages of the pipeline.
The _access type_ is a function of the <<descriptorsets, descriptor type>>
used, or how a fixed-function stage accesses memory.
Each access type corresponds to a bit flag in slink:VkAccessFlagBits.

[[synchronization-access-masks]]
Some synchronization commands take sets of access types as parameters to
define the <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scopes>> of
a memory dependency.
If a synchronization command includes a source access mask, its first
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> only includes
accesses via the access types specified in that mask.
Similarly, if a synchronization command includes a destination access mask,
its second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> only
includes accesses via the access types specified in that mask.

// refBegin VkAccessFlagBits Bitmask specifying memory access types that will participate in a memory dependency

    visible to all future read accesses on entities known to the Vulkan
    device.

Certain access types are only performed by a subset of pipeline stages.
Any synchronization command that takes both stage masks and access masks
uses both to define the <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access
scopes>> - only the specified access types performed by the specified stages
are included in the access scope.
An application must: not specify an access flag in a synchronization command
if it does not include a pipeline stage in the corresponding stage mask that
is able to perform accesses of that type.
The following table lists, for each access flag, which pipeline stages can:
perform that type of access.

[[synchronization-framebuffer-regions]]
=== Framebuffer Region Dependencies

<<synchronization-pipeline-stages, Pipeline stages>> that operate on, or
with respect to, the framebuffer are collectively the _framebuffer-space_
pipeline stages.
These stages are:

  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT
  * ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT

For these pipeline stages, an execution or memory dependency from the first
set of operations to the second set can: either be a single
_framebuffer-global_ dependency, or split into multiple _framebuffer-local_
dependencies.
A dependency with non-framebuffer-space pipeline stages is neither
framebuffer-global nor framebuffer-local.

A _framebuffer region_ is a set of sample (x, y, layer, sample) coordinates
that is a subset of the entire framebuffer.

A single framebuffer-local dependency guarantees that only for a single
framebuffer region, the first set of operations and availability operations
happen-before visibility operations and the second set of operations.
No ordering guarantees are made between framebuffer regions for a
framebuffer-local dependency.

A framebuffer-global dependency guarantees that the first set of operations
for all framebuffer regions happens-before the second set of operations for
any framebuffer region.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Since fragment invocations are not specified to run in any particular
groupings, the size of a framebuffer region is implementation-dependent, not
known to the application, and must: be assumed to be no larger than a single
sample.
====

If a synchronization command includes a pname:dependencyFlags parameter, and
specifies the ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT flag, then it defines
framebuffer-local dependencies for the framebuffer-space pipeline stages in
that synchronization command, for all framebuffer regions.
If no pname:dependencyFlags parameter is included, or the
ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT flag is not specified, then a
framebuffer-global dependency is specified for those stages.
The ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT flag does not affect the dependencies
between non-framebuffer-space pipeline stages, nor does it affect the
dependencies between framebuffer-space and non-framebuffer-space pipeline
stages.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Framebuffer-local dependencies are more optimal for most architectures;
particularly tile-based architectures - which can keep framebuffer-regions
entirely in on-chip registers and thus avoid external bandwidth across such
a dependency.
Including a framebuffer-global dependency in your rendering will usually
force all implementations to flush data to memory, or to a higher level
cache, breaking any potential locality optimizations.

[[synchronization-fences]]
== Fences

// refBegin VkFence Opaque handle to a fence object

Fences are a synchronization primitive that can: be used to insert a
dependency from a queue to the host.
Fences have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
A fence can: be signaled as part of the execution of a
<<devsandqueues-submission, queue submission>> command.
Fences can: be unsignaled on the host with flink:vkResetFences.
Fences can: be waited on by the host with the flink:vkWaitForFences command,
and the current state can: be queried with flink:vkGetFenceStatus.

Fences are represented by sname:VkFence handles:

include::../api/handles/VkFence.txt[]

// refEnd VkFence

// refBegin vkCreateFence Create a new fence object

To create a fence, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateFence.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the fence.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkFenceCreateInfo structure which contains information about how
    the fence is to be created.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the

[width="80%",options="header"]
|====
| Status | Meaning
| ename:VK_SUCCESS | The fence specified by pname:fence is signaled.
| ename:VK_NOT_READY | The fence specified by pname:fence is unsignaled.

[[synchronization-fences-unsignaling]]
// refBegin vkResetFences Resets one or more fence objects

To set the state of fences to unsignaled from the host, call:

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the fences.
  * pname:fenceCount is the number of fences to reset.
  * pname:pFences is a pointer to an array of fence handles to reset.

When flink:vkResetFences is executed on the host, it defines a _fence
unsignal operation_ for each fence, which resets the fence to the unsignaled
state.

If any member of pname:pFences is already in the unsignaled state when
flink:vkResetFences is executed, then flink:vkResetFences has no effect on
that fence.

.Valid Usage
****
  * Any given element of pname:pFences must: not currently be associated
    with any queue command that has not yet completed execution on that
    queue
****

include::../validity/protos/vkResetFences.txt[]

[[synchronization-fences-signaling]]
When a fence is submitted to a queue as part of a
<<devsandqueues-submission, queue submission>> command, it defines a memory
dependency on the batches that were submitted as part of that command, and
defines a _fence signal operation_ which sets the fence to the signaled
state.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes every batch submitted in the same <<devsandqueues-submission, queue
submission>> command.
Fence signal operations that are defined by flink:vkQueueSubmit additionally
include all previous queue submissions to the same queue via
flink:vkQueueSubmit in the first synchronization scope.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
only includes the fence signal operation.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>>
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
empty.

// refBegin vkWaitForFences Wait for one or more fences to become signaled

To wait for one or more fences to enter the signaled state on the host,
call:

include::../api/protos/vkWaitForFences.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the fences.
  * pname:fenceCount is the number of fences to wait on.
  * pname:pFences is a pointer to an array of pname:fenceCount fence
    handles.
  * pname:waitAll is the condition that must: be satisfied to successfully
    unblock the wait.
    If pname:waitAll is ename:VK_TRUE, then the condition is that all fences
    in pname:pFences are signaled.
    Otherwise, the condition is that at least one fence in pname:pFences is
    signaled.
  * pname:timeout is the timeout period in units of nanoseconds.
    pname:timeout is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the
    implementation-dependent timeout accuracy, which may: be substantially
    longer than one nanosecond, and may: be longer than the requested
    period.

If the condition is satisfied when fname:vkWaitForFences is called, then
fname:vkWaitForFences returns immediately.
If the condition is not satisfied at the time fname:vkWaitForFences is
called, then fname:vkWaitForFences will block and wait up to pname:timeout
nanoseconds for the condition to become satisfied.

If pname:timeout is zero, then fname:vkWaitForFences does not wait, but
simply returns the current state of the fences.
ename:VK_TIMEOUT will be returned in this case if the condition is not
satisfied, even though no actual wait was performed.

If the specified timeout period expires before the condition is satisfied,
fname:vkWaitForFences returns ename:VK_TIMEOUT.
If the condition is satisfied before pname:timeout nanoseconds has expired,
fname:vkWaitForFences returns ename:VK_SUCCESS.

include::../validity/protos/vkWaitForFences.txt[]

[[synchronization-fences-waiting]]
An execution dependency is defined by waiting for a fence to become
signaled, either via flink:vkWaitForFences or by polling on
flink:vkGetFenceStatus.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes only the fence signal operation.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes the host operations of flink:vkWaitForFences or
flink:vkGetFenceStatus indicating that the fence has become signaled.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Signaling a fence and waiting on the host does not guarantee that the
results of memory accesses will be visible to the host.
To provide that guarantee, the application must: insert a memory barrier
between the device writes and the end of the submission that will signal the
fence, with pname:dstAccessMask having the ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT bit
set, with pname:dstStageMask having the ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT bit
set, and with the appropriate pname:srcStageMask and pname:srcAccessMask
members set to guarantee completion of the writes.
If the memory was allocated without the
ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, then
fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges must: be called after the fence is
signaled in order to ensure the writes are visible to the host, as described
in <<memory-device-hostaccess,Host Access to Device Memory Objects>>.

Semaphores have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
The state of a semaphore can: be signaled after execution of a batch of

[[synchronization-semaphores-signaling]]
=== Semaphore Signaling

When a batch is submitted to a queue via a <<devsandqueues-submission, queue
submission>>, and it includes semaphores to be signaled, it defines a memory
dependency on the batch, and defines _semaphore signal operations_ which set
the semaphores to the signaled state.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes every command submitted in the same batch.
Semaphore signal operations that are defined by flink:vkQueueSubmit
additionally include all batches previously submitted to the same queue via
flink:vkQueueSubmit, including batches that are submitted in the same
<<devsandqueues-submission, queue submission>> command, but at a lower index
within the array of batches.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes only the semaphore signal operation.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>>
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
empty.


[[synchronization-semaphores-waiting]]
=== Semaphore Waiting & Unsignaling

When a batch is submitted to a queue via a <<devsandqueues-submission, queue
submission>>, and it includes semaphores to be waited on, it defines a
memory dependency between prior semaphore signal operations and the batch,
and defines _semaphore unsignal operations_ which set the semaphores to the
unsignaled state.

The first synchronization scope includes all semaphore signal operations
that operate on semaphores waited on in the same batch, and that
happen-before the wait completes.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes every command submitted in the same batch.
In the case of flink:vkQueueSubmit, the second synchronization scope is
limited to operations on the pipeline stages determined by the
<<synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks, destination stage mask>> specified
by the corresponding element of pname:pWaitDstStageMask.
Also, in the case of flink:vkQueueSubmit, the second synchronization scope
additionally includes all batches subsequently submitted to the same queue
via flink:vkQueueSubmit, including batches that are submitted in the same
<<devsandqueues-submission, queue submission>> command, but at a higher
index within the array of batches.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
empty.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>>
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The semaphore unsignal operation happens-after the first set of operations
in the execution dependency, and happens-before the second set of operations
in the execution dependency.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Unlike fences or events, the act of waiting for a semaphore also unsignals
that semaphore.
If two operations are separately specified to wait for the same semaphore,
and there are no other execution dependencies between those operations,
behaviour is undefined.
An execution dependency must: be present that guarantees that the semaphore
unsignal operation for the first of those waits, happens-before the
semaphore is signalled again, and before the second unsignal operation.
Semaphore waits and signals should thus occur in discrete 1:1 pairs.
====

ifdef::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
.Note
[NOTE]
====
A common scenario for using pname:pWaitDstStageMask with values other than
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT is when synchronizing a window
system presentation operation against subsequent command buffers which
render the next frame.
In this case, a presentation image must: not be overwritten until the
presentation operation completes, but other pipeline stages can: execute
without waiting.
A mask of ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT prevents
subsequent color attachment writes from executing until the semaphore
signals.
Some implementations may: be able to execute transfer operations and/or
vertex processing work before the semaphore is signaled.

If an image layout transition needs to be performed on a swapchain image
before it is used in a framebuffer, that can: be performed as the first
operation submitted to the queue after acquiring the image, and should: not
prevent other work from overlapping with the presentation operation.
For example, a sname:VkImageMemoryBarrier could use:

  * pname:srcStageMask = ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT
  * pname:srcAccessMask = 0
  * pname:dstStageMask = ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT
  * pname:dstAccessMask = ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT |
    ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT.
  * pname:oldLayout = etext:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR
  * pname:newLayout = ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL

Alternatively, pname:oldLayout can: be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, if
the image's contents need not be preserved.

This barrier accomplishes a dependency chain between previous presentation
operations and subsequent color attachment output operations, with the
layout transition performed in between, and does not introduce a dependency
between previous work and any vertex processing stages.
More precisely, the semaphore signals after the presentation operation
completes, then the semaphore wait stalls the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT stage, then there is a
dependency from that same stage to itself with the layout transition
performed in between.

[[synchronization-events]]
== Events

// refBegin VkEvent Opaque handle to a event object

Events are a synchronization primitive that can: be used to insert a
fine-grained dependency between commands submitted to the same queue, or
between the host and a queue.
Events have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
An application can: signal an event, or unsignal it, on either the host or
the device.
A device can: wait for an event to become signaled before executing further
operations.
No command exists to wait for an event to become signaled on the host, but
the current state of an event can: be queried.

Events are represented by sname:VkEvent handles:

When flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier is submitted to a queue, it defines a memory
dependency between commands that were submitted before it, and those
submitted after it.

If flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded outside a render pass instance,
the first <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>

those in the same command buffer and batch.
If flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier was recorded inside a render pass instance,
the first synchronization scope includes only commands submitted before it
within the same subpass.
In either case, the first synchronization scope is limited to operations on
the pipeline stages determined by the

Within that, the first access scope only includes the first access scopes
defined by elements of the pname:pMemoryBarriers,
pname:pBufferMemoryBarriers and pname:pImageMemoryBarriers arrays, which
each define a set of <<synchronization-memory-barriers, memory barriers>>.
If no memory barriers are specified, then the first access scope includes no

[[synchronization-pipeline-barriers-subpass-self-dependencies]]
=== Subpass Self-dependency

If fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier is called inside a render pass instance, the
following restrictions apply.
For a given subpass to allow a pipeline barrier, the render pass must:
declare a _self-dependency_ from that subpass to itself.
That is, there must: exist a sname:VkSubpassDependency in the subpass
dependency list for the render pass with pname:srcSubpass and
pname:dstSubpass equal to that subpass index.
More than one self-dependency can: be declared for each subpass.
Self-dependencies must: only include pipeline stage bits that are graphics
stages.
Self-dependencies must: not have any earlier pipeline stages depend on any
later pipeline stages.
More precisely, this means that whatever is the last pipeline stage in
pname:srcStageMask must: be no later than whatever is the first pipeline
stage in pname:dstStageMask (the latest source stage can: be equal to the
earliest destination stage).
If the source and destination stage masks both include framebuffer-space
stages, then pname:dependencyFlags must: include
ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT.

A fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier command inside a render pass instance must: be
a _subset_ of one of the self-dependencies of the subpass it is used in,
meaning that the stage masks and access masks must: each include only a
subset of the bits of the corresponding mask in that self-dependency.
If the self-dependency has ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT set, then so
must: the pipeline barrier.
Pipeline barriers within a render pass instance can: only be types
sname:VkMemoryBarrier or sname:VkImageMemoryBarrier.
If a sname:VkImageMemoryBarrier is used, the image and image subresource
range specified in the barrier must: be a subset of one of the image views
used by the framebuffer in the current subpass.
Additionally, pname:oldLayout must: be equal to pname:newLayout, and both
the pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex and pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex must: be
ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED.


[[synchronization-memory-barriers]]
== Memory Barriers

_Memory barriers_ are used to explicitly control access to buffer and image
subresource ranges.
Memory barriers are used to <<synchronization-queue-transfers, transfer
ownership between queue families>>,
<<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, change image layouts>>, and
define <<synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible, availability
and visibility operations>>.
They explicitly define the <<synchronization-access-types, access types>>
and buffer and image subresource ranges that are included in the
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scopes>> of a memory
dependency that is created by a synchronization command that includes them.

[[synchronization-global-memory-barriers]]
=== Global Memory Barriers

Global memory barriers apply to memory accesses involving all memory objects
that exist at the time of its execution.

// refBegin VkMemoryBarrier Structure specifying a global memory barrier

The sname:VkMemoryBarrier structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkMemoryBarrier.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks, source
    access mask>>.
  * pname:dstAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks,
    destination access mask>>.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, source access

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, destination
access mask>> specified by pname:dstAccessMask.

include::../validity/structs/VkMemoryBarrier.txt[]



[[synchronization-buffer-memory-barriers]]
=== Buffer Memory Barriers

Buffer memory barriers only apply to memory accesses involving a specific
buffer range.
That is, a memory dependency formed from an buffer memory barrier is
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, scoped>> to access via the
specified buffer range.
Buffer memory barriers can: also be used to define a
<<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>> for the
specified buffer range.

// refBegin VkBufferMemoryBarrier Structure specifying a buffer memory barrier

The sname:VkBufferMemoryBarrier structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkBufferMemoryBarrier.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks, source
    access mask>>.
  * pname:dstAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks,
    destination access mask>>.
  * pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is the source queue family for a
    <<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>>.
  * pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is the destination queue family for a
    <<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>>.
  * pname:buffer is a handle to the buffer whose backing memory is affected
    by the barrier.
  * pname:offset is an offset in bytes into the backing memory for
    pname:buffer; this is relative to the base offset as bound to the buffer
    (see flink:vkBindBufferMemory).
  * pname:size is a size in bytes of the affected area of backing memory for
    pname:buffer, or ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to use the range from pname:offset
    to the end of the buffer.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access to memory through the specified buffer range, via access
types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, source access mask>> specified
by pname:srcAccessMask.
If pname:srcAccessMask includes ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT, memory
writes performed by that access type are also made visible, as that access
type is not performed through a resource.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access to memory through the specified buffer range, via access
types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, destination access mask>>
specified by pname:dstAccessMask.
If pname:dstAccessMask includes ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT or
ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT, available memory writes are also made visible
to accesses of those types, as those access types are not performed through
a resource.

If pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is not equal to pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex, and
pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a <<synchronization-queue-transfers-release, queue
family release operation>> for the specified buffer range, and the second
access scope includes no access, as if pname:dstAccessMask was `0`.

If pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is not equal to pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex, and
pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a <<synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire, queue
family acquire operation>> for the specified buffer range, and the first
access scope includes no access, as if pname:srcAccessMask was `0`.

Image memory barriers only apply to memory accesses involving a specific
image subresource range.
That is, a memory dependency formed from an image memory barrier is
<<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, scoped>> to access via the
specified image subresource range.
Image memory barriers can: also be used to define
<<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, image layout transitions>> or a
<<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>> for the
specified image subresource range.

// refBegin VkImageMemoryBarrier Structure specifying the parameters of an image memory barrier

The sname:VkImageMemoryBarrier structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageMemoryBarrier.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks, source
    access mask>>.
  * pname:dstAccessMask defines a <<synchronization-access-masks,
    destination access mask>>.
  * pname:oldLayout is the old layout in an
    <<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, image layout transition>>.
  * pname:newLayout is the new layout in an
    <<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, image layout transition>>.
  * pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is the source queue family for a
    <<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>>.
  * pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is the destination queue family for a
    <<synchronization-queue-transfers, queue family ownership transfer>>.
  * pname:image is a handle to the image affected by this barrier.
  * pname:subresourceRange describes the <<resources-image-views, image
    subresource range>> within pname:image that is affected by this barrier.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access to memory through the specified image subresource range,
via access types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, source access mask>>
specified by pname:srcAccessMask.
If pname:srcAccessMask includes ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT, memory
writes performed by that access type are also made visible, as that access
type is not performed through a resource.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>> is
limited to access to memory through the specified image subresource range,
via access types in the <<synchronization-access-masks, destination access
mask>> specified by pname:dstAccessMask.
If pname:dstAccessMask includes ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT or
ename:VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT, available memory writes are also made visible
to accesses of those types, as those access types are not performed through
a resource.

If pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is not equal to pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex, and
pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a <<synchronization-queue-transfers-release, queue
family release operation>> for the specified image subresource range, and
the second access scope includes no access, as if pname:dstAccessMask was
`0`.

If pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is not equal to pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex, and
pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a <<synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire, queue
family acquire operation>> for the specified image subresource range, and
the first access scope includes no access, as if pname:srcAccessMask was
`0`.

If pname:oldLayout is not equal to pname:newLayout, then the memory barrier
defines an <<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, image layout
transition>> for the specified image subresource range.
Layout transitions that are performed via image memory barriers
automatically happen-after layout transitions previously submitted to the
same queue, and automatically happen-before layout transitions subsequently
submitted to the same queue; this includes layout transitions that occur as
part of a render pass instance, in both cases.

[[synchronization-queue-transfers]]
=== Queue Family Ownership Transfer

Resources created with a elink:VkSharingMode of
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE must: have their ownership explicitly
transferred from one queue family to another in order to access their
content in a well-defined manner on a queue in a different queue family.
If memory dependencies are correctly expressed between uses of such a
resource between two queues in different families, but no ownership transfer
is defined, the contents of that resource are undefined for any read
accesses performed by the second queue family.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If an application does not need the contents of a resource to remain valid
when transferring from one queue family to another, then the ownership
transfer should: be skipped.
====

A queue family ownership transfer consists of two distinct parts:

  . Release exclusive ownership from the source queue family
  . Acquire exclusive ownership for the destination queue family

An application must: ensure that these operations occur in the correct order
by defining an execution dependency between them, e.g. using a semaphore.

[[synchronization-queue-transfers-release]] A _release operation_ is used to
release exclusive ownership of a range of a buffer or image subresource
range.
A release operation is defined by executing a
<<synchronization-buffer-memory-barriers, buffer memory barrier>> (for a
buffer range) or an <<synchronization-image-memory-barriers, image memory
barrier>> (for an image subresource range), on a queue from the source queue
family.
The pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex parameter of the barrier must: be set to the
source queue family index, and the pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex parameter to
the destination queue family index.
pname:dstStageMask is ignored for such a barrier, such that no visibility
operation is executed - the value of this mask does not affect the validity
of the barrier.
The release operation happens-after the availability operation.

[[synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire]] An _acquire operation_ is used
to acquire exclusive ownership of a range of a buffer or image subresource
range.
An acquire operation is defined by executing a
<<synchronization-buffer-memory-barriers, buffer memory barrier>> (for a
buffer range) or an <<synchronization-image-memory-barriers, image memory
barrier>> (for an image subresource range), on a queue from the destination
queue family.
The pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex parameter of the barrier must: be set to the
source queue family index, and the pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex parameter to
the destination queue family index.
pname:srcStageMask is ignored for such a barrier, such that no availability
operation is executed - the value of this mask does not affect the validity
of the barrier.
The acquire operation happens-before the visibility operation.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Whilst it is not invalid to provide destination or source access masks for
memory barriers used for release or acquire operations, respectively, they
have no practical effect.
Access after a release operation has undefined results, and so visibility
for those accesses has no practical effect.
Similarly, write access before an acquire operation will produce undefined
results for future access, so availability of those writes has no practical
use.
In an earlier version of the specification, these were required to match on
both sides - but this was subsequently relaxed.
It is now recommended that these masks are simply set to 0.
====

If the transfer is via an image memory barrier, and an
<<synchronization-image-layout-transitions, image layout transition>> is
desired, then the values of pname:oldLayout and pname:newLayout in the
release memory barrier must: be equal to values of pname:oldLayout and
pname:newLayout in the acquire memory barrier.
Although the image layout transition is submitted twice, it will only be
executed once.
A layout transition specified in this way happens-after the release
operation and happens-before the acquire operation.

If the values of pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex and pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex are
equal, no ownership transfer is performed, and the barrier operates as if
they were both set to ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED.

Queue family ownership transfers may: perform read and write accesses on all
memory bound to the image subresource or buffer range, so applications must:
ensure that all memory writes have been made
<<synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible, available>> before a
queue family ownership transfer is executed.
Available memory is automatically made visible to queue family release and
acquire operations, and writes performed by those operations are
automatically made available.

Once a queue family has acquired ownership of a buffer range or image
subresource range of an ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE resource, its
contents are undefined to other queue families unless ownership is
transferred.
The contents of any portion of another resource which aliases memory that is
bound to the transferred buffer or image subresource range are undefined
after a release or acquire operation.


[[synchronization-wait-idle]]
== Wait Idle Operations

// refBegin vkQueueWaitIdle Wait for a queue to become idle

To wait on the host for the completion of outstanding queue operations for a
given queue, call:

include::../api/protos/vkQueueWaitIdle.txt[]

  * pname:queue is the queue on which to wait.

fname:vkQueueWaitIdle is equivalent to submitting a fence to a queue and
waiting with an infinite timeout for that fence to signal.

include::../validity/protos/vkQueueWaitIdle.txt[]

// refBegin vkDeviceWaitIdle Wait for a device to become idle

To wait on the host for the completion of outstanding queue operations for
all queues on a given logical device, call:

include::../api/protos/vkDeviceWaitIdle.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device to idle.

fname:vkDeviceWaitIdle is equivalent to calling fname:vkQueueWaitIdle for
all queues owned by pname:device.

include::../validity/protos/vkDeviceWaitIdle.txt[]


[[synchronization-submission-host-writes]]
== Host Write Ordering Guarantees

When batches of command buffers are submitted to a queue via
flink:vkQueueSubmit, it defines a memory dependency with prior host
operations, and execution of command buffers submitted to the queue.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>> is
defined by the host execution model, but includes execution of
flink:vkQueueSubmit on the host and anything that happened-before it.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-scopes, synchronization scope>>
includes every command submitted in the same <<devsandqueues-submission,
queue submission>> command, and all future submissions to the same queue.

The first <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>>
includes all host writes to mappable device memory that are either coherent,
or have been flushed with flink:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges.

The second <<synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes, access scope>>
includes all memory access performed by the device.
