[[commandbuffers]]
= 命令缓冲区

// refBegin VkCommandBuffer Opaque handle to a command buffer object

命令缓冲区是用来记录命令的对象，可以顺序的提交到队列以供执行。有两个级别的命令缓冲区：
_主命令缓冲区_（可以执行次命令缓冲区，被提交到队列），_次命令缓冲区_（可以被主命令缓冲区执行，不直接被提交到队列）。

命令缓冲区通过sname:VkCommandBuffer handles表示：

include::../api/handles/VkCommandBuffer.txt[]

// refEnd VkCommandBuffer

记录的命令缓冲区包括绑定管线和描述符到命令缓冲区的命令、修改动态状态的命令、绘制命令，分发命令，执行次命令缓冲区的命令、
复制缓冲区和图像等命令。

[[commandbuffers-statereset]]
每一个命令缓冲区都独立的管理状态。主、次命令缓冲区之间或者两个次级命令缓冲区之间并不继承状态。
当一个命令缓冲区开始记录，该命令缓冲区所有的状态是未定义的。
当次级命令缓冲区被记录以备在主命令缓冲区上执行时，次级命令缓冲区并不从主命令缓冲区继承状态，
在执行次级命令缓冲区后被记录后主命令缓冲区的所有状态是未定义的。
对于这条规则有一个例外--如果主命令缓冲区在一个渲染pass实例中，那么这个renderpass和subpass状态
并不会被次级命令缓冲区的执行所干扰。
当命令缓冲区的状态是未定义时，应用程序必须在依赖诸如绘制、分发的命令被记录之前
设置命令缓冲区上的相关状态，否则执行命令缓冲区的导致的行为是未知的。

除非特别指定了，或者显式地进行同步，通过命令缓冲区把提交到队列的各种命令才能以任意的顺序，
或者同时执行。还有，若没有显式的内存依赖，这些命令带来的内存副作用可能并不会直接被其他命令看到。
在同一个命令缓冲区，提交到一个指定队列的不同命令缓冲区之间都是有效的。
查看<<synchronization, the synchronization chapter>> 来获取命令之间<<synchronization-implicit, 隐式的>> 
和显式同步的信息。

Each command buffer is always in one of three states:

  * _Initial state_: Before flink:vkBeginCommandBuffer.
    Either flink:vkBeginCommandBuffer has never been called, or the command
    buffer has been reset since it last recorded commands.
  * _Recording state_: Between flink:vkBeginCommandBuffer and
    flink:vkEndCommandBuffer.
    The command buffer is in a state where it can: record commands.
  * _Executable state_: After flink:vkEndCommandBuffer.
    The command buffer is in a state where it has finished recording
    commands and can: be executed.

_重置_ 一个命令缓冲区是一个把之前记录的命令抛弃并把命令缓冲区置为初始状态的操作。
重置是 flink:vkResetCommandBuffer、flink:vkResetCommandPool，或者
flink:vkBeginCommandBuffer（当把一个命令缓冲区放到记录状态）调用的结果。


[[commandbuffers-pools]]
== 命令池

// refBegin VkCommandPool Opaque handle to a command pool object
命令缓存池是一个不透明对象，可从之分配出命令缓冲区内存，它可允许Vulkan实现均摊多个命令缓冲区
创建资源的开销。命令缓存池需要在外部保持同步，意味着一个命令缓存池不能同时被多个线程使用。
这包括通过记录命令到任何从缓存池中获取的命令缓冲区，和分配、释放、重置命令缓冲区或命令缓存池本身
等操作。

Command pools are represented by sname:VkCommandPool handles:

include::../api/handles/VkCommandPool.txt[]

// refEnd VkCommandPool

// refBegin vkCreateCommandPool Create a new command pool object

To create a command pool, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateCommandPool.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the command pool.
  * pname:pCreateInfo contains information used to create the command pool.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pCommandPool points to a sname:VkCommandPool handle in which the
    created pool is returned.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateCommandPool.txt[]

// refBegin VkCommandPoolCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created command pool

The sname:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkCommandPoolCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask indicating usage behavior for the pool and
    command buffers allocated from it.
    Bits which can: be set include:
+
--
// refBegin VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits Bitmask specifying usage behavior for a command pool
include::../api/enums/VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits.txt[]

+
  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT indicates that command
     buffers allocated from the pool will be short-lived, meaning that they
     will be reset or freed in a relatively short timeframe.
     This flag may: be used by the implementation to control memory
     allocation behavior within the pool.
  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT controls whether
     command buffers allocated from the pool can: be individually reset.
     If this flag is set, individual command buffers allocated from the pool
     can: be reset either explicitly, by calling fname:vkResetCommandBuffer,
     or implicitly, by calling fname:vkBeginCommandBuffer on an executable
     command buffer.
     If this flag is not set, then fname:vkResetCommandBuffer and
     fname:vkBeginCommandBuffer (on an executable command buffer) must: not
     be called on the command buffers allocated from the pool, and they can:
     only be reset in bulk by calling fname:vkResetCommandPool.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex designates a queue family as described in section
    <<devsandqueues-queueprops,Queue Family Properties>>.
    All command buffers allocated from this command pool must: be submitted
    on queues from the same queue family.

****
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex must: be the index of a queue family available in
    the calling command's pname:device parameter

// refBegin vkTrimCommandPoolKHR Trim a command pool

To trim a command pool, call:

include::../api/protos/vkTrimCommandPoolKHR.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the command pool.
  * pname:commandPool is the command pool to trim.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.

Trimming a command pool recycles unused memory from the command pool back to
the system.
Command buffers allocated from the pool are not affected by the command.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
这个命令给应用程序提供了命令缓存池使用的内置内存分配之上的控制权。

未使用的内存通常来自于被记录但之后被重置的命令缓冲区，它们不再使用内存了。
重置之后，一个命令缓冲区可以把内存归还到命令缓存池，但是，释放内存归还到操作系统的唯一方式
需要调用 flink:vkResetCommandPool，在从缓存池中获取的命令仍在使用时不能执行该函数。
随后进入命令缓冲区的记录操作将重用这部分内存，但是，因为总的内存需求量随着时间波动，未使用的内存可以累积。

在这种情况下，修剪命令缓存池把内存归还到操作系统是很有用的，把从缓存池获取的总使用量显著的内存恢复到一个平均的水平。

Vulkan实现尽可能的利用内置内存分配策略，这就让所有未使用内存都被释放到系统编程不可能的事情。
例如，命令缓冲区的某种实现也许涉及到块状地从系统分配内存，并从该内存块中更小规模的分配内存。在这种实现中，
任何在使用中的并持有该块状内存reference的命令缓冲区都将阻止该内存被释放，甚至该块状内存中只有很小一部分正在被使用。

在大多数情况下，修剪工作将导致已分配但未使用内存量的减少，但是并不保证产生“理想”的行为。

修剪是代价昂贵的操作，不应该经常调用。
修剪应该被当作在应用程序在已知存在足够的未使用内存、修剪的代价值得的时候释放内存压力的一种方式。

次命令缓冲区被认为从它的执行被记录到主缓冲区（）到主缓冲区提交到队列完成的最终时刻，是出于暂停执行状态的。
如果，在主缓冲区完成了，次缓冲区被记录到另外一个主缓冲区上执行，第一个主缓冲区不能被再次提交，直到通过
flink:vkResetCommandBuffer 被重置，除非次命令缓冲区以ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT

====
提交可能是一个代价很高的操作，应用程序应该尝试批量的工作，尽量少的调用fname:vkQueueSubmit。
====

    once the commands specified in pname:pCommandBuffers have completed
    execution.
  * pname:pSignalSemaphores is a pointer to an array of semaphores which
    will be signaled when the command buffers for this batch have completed
    execution.
    If semaphores to be signaled are provided, they define a
    <<synchronization-semaphores-signaling, semaphore signal operation>>.

The order that command buffers appear in pname:pCommandBuffers is used to
determine <<synchronization-submission-order, submission order>>, and thus
all the <<synchronization-implicit, implicit ordering guarantees>> that
respect it.
Other than these implicit ordering guarantees and any <<synchronization,
explicit synchronization primitives>>, these command buffers may: overlap or
otherwise execute out of order.

[[commandbuffers-submission-progress]]
== 队列发送进度（Queue Forward Progress）

应用程序必须保证在任何队列上没有剩下的操作时命令缓冲区提交将能够完成。
在fname:vkQueueSubmit调用之后，对等待一个信号量的每个排队等待者必须是一个比信号量更早的信号，
该信号量不会被一个不同的等待者消耗。

提交的命令缓冲区可以包含等待不会被队列中更早的命令所激发的事件的flink:vkCmdWaitEvents命令，
这些事件必须通过应用程序使用flink:vkSetEvent来激发，且等待这些事件的fname:vkCmdWaitEvents命令不能在一个render pass内。
Vulkan实现可能对命令缓冲区等待的时长有限制，以避免和设备的其他clients的工作进度有干扰。
如果没有这些限制条件下事件被激发了，结果是未定义的，可能包括设备丢失。


[[commandbuffers-secondary]]
== 次级命令缓冲区的执行

// refBegin vkCmdExecuteCommands Execute a secondary command buffer from a primary command buffer

次命令缓冲区必须不能直接被提交到队列。相反，需要被记录到主命令缓冲区的一部分来被执行：

include::../api/protos/vkCmdExecuteCommands.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is a handle to a primary command buffer that the
    secondary command buffers are executed in.
  * pname:commandBufferCount is the length of the pname:pCommandBuffers
    array.
  * pname:pCommandBuffers is an array of secondary command buffer handles,
    which are recorded to execute in the primary command buffer in the order
    they are listed in the array.

一旦fname:vkCmdExecuteCommands被调用，在任何主命令缓冲区中的由pname:pCommandBuffers指定的次命令缓冲区之前的任何执行工作都被无效化了，
除非这些次命令缓冲区被记录时带有ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT。
