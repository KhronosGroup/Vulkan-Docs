[[display_swapchain_present,display_swapchain_present]]

When the VK_KHR_display_swapchain extension is enabled additional fields
can: be specified when presenting an image to a
swapchain by setting pname:VkPresentInfoKHR::pNext to point to a
sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR structure, which is defined as follows:

include::../../structs/VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DISPLAY_PRESENT_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcRect is a rectangular region of pixels to present.  It must: be
    a subset of the image being presented.  If sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is
    not specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire presentable
    image.
  * pname:dstRect is a rectangular region within the visible region of
    the swapchain's display mode.  If sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not
    specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire visible region of
    the visible region of the swapchain's mode.  If the specified rectangle
    is a subset of the display mode's visible region, content from display
    planes below the swapchain's plane will be visible outside the rectangle.
    If there are no planes below the swapchain's, the area outside the
    specified rectangle will be black.  If portions of the specified rectangle
    are outside of the display's visible region, pixels mapping only to those
    portions of the rectangle will be discarded.
  * pname:persistent: If this is ename:VK_TRUE, the display engine will enable
    buffered mode on displays that support it.  This allows the display engine
    to stop sending content to the display until a new image is presented.  The
    display will instead maintain a copy of the last presented image.  This
    allows less power to be used, but may: increase presentation latency.  If
    sname:VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not specified, persistent mode will not be
    used.

If the extent of the pname:srcRect and pname:dstRect are not equal, the
presented pixels will be scaled accordingly.
