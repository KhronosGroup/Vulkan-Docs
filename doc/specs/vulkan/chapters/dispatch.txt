= Dispatching Commands

_Dispatching commands_ (commands with ftext:Dispatch in the name) provoke
work in a compute pipeline.
Dispatching commands are recorded into a command buffer and when executed by
a queue, will produce work which executes according to the currently bound
compute pipeline.
A compute pipeline must: be bound to a command buffer before any dispatch
commands are recorded in that command buffer.

// refBegin vkCmdDispatch Dispatch compute work items

To record a dispatch, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdDispatch.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:groupCountX is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the X
    dimension.
  * pname:groupCountY is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Y
    dimension.
  * pname:groupCountZ is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Z
    dimension.

When the command is executed, a global workgroup consisting of
[eq]#groupCountX {times} groupCountY {times} groupCountZ# local workgroups
is assembled.

code:WorkgroupId, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdDispatchBaseKHX.txt[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:baseGroupX is the start value for the X component of
    code:WorkgroupId.

    dimension.
  * pname:groupCountY is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Y
    dimension.

    dimension.

When the command is executed, a global workgroup consisting of
[eq]#groupCountX {times} groupCountY {times} groupCountZ# local workgroups
is assembled, with code:WorkgroupId values ranging from [eq]#[baseGroup,
baseGroup {plus} groupCount)# in each component.
