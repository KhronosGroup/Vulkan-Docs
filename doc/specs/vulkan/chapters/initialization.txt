[[initialization]]
= Initialization

Before using Vulkan, an application must: initialize it by loading the
Vulkan commands, and creating a sname:VkInstance object.

[[initialization-functionpointers]]
== Command Function Pointers

// refBegin vkGetInstanceProcAddr Return a function pointer for a command

Vulkan commands are not necessarily exposed statically on a platform.
Function pointers for all Vulkan commands can: be obtained with the command:

include::../api/protos/vkGetInstanceProcAddr.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance that the function pointer will be
    compatible with, or `NULL` for commands not dependent on any instance.
  * pname:pName is the name of the command to obtain.

fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr itself is obtained in a platform- and loader-
specific manner.
Typically, the loader library will export this command as a function symbol,
so applications can: link against the loader library, or load it dynamically
and look up the symbol using platform-specific APIs.
Loaders are encouraged to export function symbols for all other core Vulkan
commands as well; if this is done, then applications that use only the core
Vulkan commands have no need to use fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr.

The table below defines the various use cases for
fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr and expected return value ("fp" is function
pointer) for each case.

The returned function pointer is of type tlink:PFN_vkVoidFunction, and must
be cast to the type of the command being queried.

1::
    The returned function pointer must: only be called with a dispatchable
    object (the first parameter) that is pname:instance or a child of
    pname:instance.
    e.g. sname:VkInstance, sname:VkPhysicalDevice, sname:VkDevice,
    sname:VkQueue, or sname:VkCommandBuffer.

2::
    An ``available extension'' is an extension function supported by any of
    the loader, driver or layer.

// refEnd vkGetInstanceProcAddr PFN_vkVoidFunction

// refBegin vkGetDeviceProcAddr Return a function pointer for a command

In order to support systems with multiple Vulkan implementations comprising
heterogeneous collections of hardware and software, the function pointers
returned by fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr may: point to dispatch code, which
calls a different real implementation for different sname:VkDevice objects
(and objects created from them).
The overhead of this internal dispatch can: be avoided by obtaining
device-specific function pointers for any commands that use a device or
device-child object as their dispatchable object.
Such function pointers can: be obtained with the command:

include::../api/protos/vkGetDeviceProcAddr.txt[]

The table below defines the various use cases for fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr
and expected return value for each case.

The returned function pointer is of type tlink:PFN_vkVoidFunction, and must
be cast to the type of the command being queried.

=== Extending Physical Device From Device Extensions

When the +VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2+ extension is enabled,
physical device extension commands and structures can: be used with a
physical device if the corresponding extension is enumerated by
flink:vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties for that physical device, even
before a logical device has been created.

To obtain a function pointer for a physical-device command from a device
extension, an application can: use fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr.
This function pointer may: point to dispatch code, which calls a different
real implementation for different sname:VkPhysicalDevice objects.
Behavior is undefined if an extension physical-device command is called on a
physical device that doesn't support the extension.

Device extensions may: define structures that can: be added to the
pNext-chain of physical-device commands.
Behavior is undefined if such an extension structure is passed to a physical
device command for a physical device that doesn't support the extension.

[[initialization-instances]]
== Instances

// refBegin VkInstance Opaque handle to a instance object

There is no global state in Vulkan and all per-application state is stored
in a sname:VkInstance object.
Creating a sname:VkInstance object initializes the Vulkan library and allows
the application to pass information about itself to the implementation.

Instances are represented by sname:VkInstance handles:

include::../api/handles/VkInstance.txt[]

// refEnd VkInstance

// refBegin vkCreateInstance Create a new Vulkan instance

To create an instance object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateInstance.txt[]

  * pname:pCreateInfo points to an instance of slink:VkInstanceCreateInfo
    controlling creation of the instance.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pInstance points a sname:VkInstance handle in which the resulting
    instance is returned.

fname:vkCreateInstance creates the instance, then enables and initializes
global layers and extensions requested by the application.
If an extension is provided by a layer, both the layer and extension must:
be specified at fname:vkCreateInstance time.
If a specified layer cannot be found, no sname:VkInstance will be created
and the function will return ename:VK_ERROR_LAYER_NOT_PRESENT.
Likewise, if a specified extension cannot be found the call will return
ename:VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateInstance.txt[]

// refBegin VkInstanceCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created instance

The sname:VkInstanceCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkInstanceCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:pApplicationInfo is `NULL` or a pointer to an instance of
    sname:VkApplicationInfo.
    If not `NULL`, this information helps implementations recognize behavior
    inherent to classes of applications.
    slink:VkApplicationInfo is defined in detail below.
  * pname:enabledLayerCount is the number of global layers to enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledLayerNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledLayerCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of layers to enable for the created instance.
    See the <<extended-functionality-layers,Layers>> section for further
    details.
  * pname:enabledExtensionCount is the number of global extensions to
    enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledExtensionNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledExtensionCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of extensions to enable.

// refBegin VkApplicationInfo Structure specifying application info

The sname:VkApplicationInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkApplicationInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:pApplicationName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string
    containing the name of the application.
  * pname:applicationVersion is an unsigned integer variable containing the
    developer-supplied version number of the application.
  * pname:pEngineName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string
    containing the name of the engine (if any) used to create the
    application.
  * pname:engineVersion is an unsigned integer variable containing the
    developer-supplied version number of the engine used to create the
    application.
  * pname:apiVersion is the version of the Vulkan API against which the
    application expects to run, encoded as described in the
    <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version Numbers and Semantics>> section.
    If pname:apiVersion is 0 the implementation must: ignore it, otherwise
    if the implementation does not support the requested pname:apiVersion it
    must: return ename:VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER.
    The patch version number specified in pname:apiVersion is ignored when
    creating an instance object.
    Only the major and minor versions of the instance must: match those
    requested in pname:apiVersion.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:apiVersion must: be zero, or otherwise it must: be a version that
    the implementation supports, or supports an effective substitute for

// refBegin vkDestroyInstance Destroy an instance of Vulkan

To destroy an instance, call:

include::../api/protos/vkDestroyInstance.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the handle of the instance to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

.Valid Usage
****
  * All child objects created using pname:instance must: have been destroyed
    prior to destroying pname:instance
  * If sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:instance was
    created, a compatible set of callbacks must: be provided here
  * If no sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:instance was
    created, pname:pAllocator must: be `NULL`
