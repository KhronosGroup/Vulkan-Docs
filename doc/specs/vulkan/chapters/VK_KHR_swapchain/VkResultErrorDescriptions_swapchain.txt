* ename:VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR
    A surface has changed in such a way that it is no longer compatible with
    the swapchain, and further presentation requests using the swapchain will
    fail.  Applications must: query the new surface properties and recreate
    their swapchain if they wish to continue presenting to the surface.
