= Resource Creation

Vulkan supports two primary resource types: _buffers_ and _images_.
Resources are views of memory with associated formatting and dimensionality.
Buffers are essentially unformatted arrays of bytes whereas images contain
format information, can: be multidimensional and may: have associated
metadata.

== Buffers

// refBegin VkBuffer Opaque handle to a buffer object

Buffers represent linear arrays of data which are used for various purposes
by binding them to a graphics or compute pipeline via descriptor sets or via
certain commands, or by directly specifying them as parameters to certain
commands.

Buffers are represented by sname:VkBuffer handles:

include::../api/handles/VkBuffer.txt[]

// refEnd VkBuffer

// refBegin vkCreateBuffer Create a new buffer object

To create buffers, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateBuffer.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the buffer object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkBufferCreateInfo structure containing parameters affecting
    creation of the buffer.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pBuffer points to a sname:VkBuffer handle in which the resulting
    buffer object is returned.

    must: not cause the total required sparse memory for all currently valid
    sparse resources on the device to exceed

    additional parameters of the buffer.
  * pname:size is the size in bytes of the buffer to be created.
  * pname:usage is a bitmask of elink:VkBufferUsageFlagBits specifying
    allowed usages of the buffer.
    Any combination of bits can: be specified for pname:usage, but at least
    one of the bits must: be set in order to create a valid buffer.
  * pname:sharingMode is a elink:VkSharingMode value specifying the sharing
    mode of the buffer when it will be accessed by multiple queue families.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndexCount is the number of entries in the
    pname:pQueueFamilyIndices array.

  * pname:offset is the byte offset from the start of the image where the
    image subresource begins.
  * pname:size is the size in bytes of the image subresource.
    pname:size includes any extra memory that is required based on
    pname:rowPitch.
  * pname:rowPitch describes the number of bytes between each row of texels
    in an image.
  * pname:arrayPitch describes the number of bytes between each array layer
    of an image.
  * pname:depthPitch describes the number of bytes between each slice of 3D
    image.

For images created with linear tiling, pname:rowPitch, pname:arrayPitch and
pname:depthPitch describe the layout of the image subresource in linear
memory.
For uncompressed formats, pname:rowPitch is the number of bytes between
texels with the same x coordinate in adjacent rows (y coordinates differ by
one).
pname:arrayPitch is the number of bytes between texels with the same x and y
coordinate in adjacent array layers of the image (array layer values differ
by one).
pname:depthPitch is the number of bytes between texels with the same x and y
coordinate in adjacent slices of a 3D image (z coordinates differ by one).
Expressed as an addressing formula, the starting byte of a texel in the
image subresource has address:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
// (x,y,z,layer) are in texel coordinates
address(x,y,z,layer) = layer*arrayPitch + z*depthPitch + y*rowPitch + x*elementSize + offset
---------------------------------------------------

For compressed formats, the pname:rowPitch is the number of bytes between
compressed texel blocks in adjacent rows.
pname:arrayPitch is the number of bytes between compressed texel blocks in
adjacent array layers.
pname:depthPitch is the number of bytes between compressed texel blocks in
adjacent slices of a 3D image.

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
// (x,y,z,layer) are in compressed texel block coordinates
address(x,y,z,layer) = layer*arrayPitch + z*depthPitch + y*rowPitch + x*compressedTexelBlockByteSize + offset;
---------------------------------------------------

pname:arrayPitch is undefined for images that were not created as arrays.
pname:depthPitch is defined only for 3D images.

For color formats, the pname:aspectMask member of sname:VkImageSubresource

For depth/stencil formats, pname:aspectMask must: be either
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT or ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT.
On implementations that store depth and stencil aspects separately, querying
each of these image subresource layouts will return a different pname:offset
and pname:size representing the region of memory used for that aspect.

[[resources-image-layouts]]
== Image Layouts

Images are stored in implementation-dependent opaque layouts in memory.
Implementations may: support several opaque layouts, and the layout used at
any given time is determined by the elink:VkImageLayout state of the image
subresource.
Each layout has limitations on what kinds of operations are supported for
image subresources using the layout.
Applications have control over which layout each image subresource uses, and
can: transition an image subresource from one layout to another.
Transitions can: happen with an image memory barrier, included as part of a
fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier or a fname:vkCmdWaitEvents command buffer command
(see <<synchronization-image-memory-barriers>>), or as part of a subpass
dependency within a render pass (see sname:VkSubpassDependency).
The image layout state is per-image subresource, and separate image
subresources of the same image can: be in different layouts at the same time
with one exception - depth and stencil aspects of a given image subresource
must: always be in the same layout.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Each layout may: offer optimal performance for a specific usage of image
memory.
For example, an image with a layout of
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL may: provide optimal
performance for use as a color attachment, but be unsupported for use in
transfer commands.
Applications can: transition an image subresource from one layout to another
in order to achieve optimal performance when the image subresource is used
for multiple kinds of operations.
After initialization, applications need not use any layout other than the
general layout, though this may: produce suboptimal performance on some
implementations.
====

Upon creation, all image subresources of an image are initially in the same
layout, where that layout is selected by the
sname:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:initialLayout member.
The pname:initialLayout must: be either ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.
If it is ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED, then the image data can: be
preinitialized by the host while using this layout, and the transition away
from this layout will preserve that data.
If it is ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, then the contents of the data are
considered to be undefined, and the transition away from this layout is not
guaranteed to preserve that data.
For either of these initial layouts, any image subresources must: be
transitioned to another layout before they are accessed by the device.

Host access to image memory is only well-defined for images created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR tiling and for image subresources of those
images which are currently in either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL
layout.
Calling flink:vkGetImageSubresourceLayout for a linear image returns a
subresource layout mapping that is valid for either of those image layouts.

// refBegin VkImageLayout Layout of image and image subresources

The set of image layouts consists of:

include::../api/enums/VkImageLayout.txt[]

The type(s) of device access supported by each layout are:

  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED does not support device access.
    This layout must: only be used as the pname:initialLayout member of
    sname:VkImageCreateInfo or sname:VkAttachmentDescription, or as the
    pname:oldLayout in an image transition.
    When transitioning out of this layout, the contents of the memory are
    not guaranteed to be preserved.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED does not support device access.
    This layout must: only be used as the pname:initialLayout member of
    sname:VkImageCreateInfo or sname:VkAttachmentDescription, or as the
    pname:oldLayout in an image transition.
    When transitioning out of this layout, the contents of the memory are
    preserved.
    This layout is intended to be used as the initial layout for an image
    whose contents are written by the host, and hence the data can: be
    written to memory immediately, without first executing a layout
    transition.
    Currently, ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED is only useful with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR images because there is not a standard
    layout defined for ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL images.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL supports all types of device access.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL must: only be used as a
    color or resolve attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL must: only be
    used as a depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL must: only be used
    as a read-only depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer and/or
    as a read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled image,
    combined image/sampler and/or input attachment).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
    Only image subresources of images created with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT can: be used as sampled image or
    combined image/sampler in a shader.
    Similarly, only image subresources of images created with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT can: be used as input
    attachments.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL must: only be used as a
    read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled image,
    combined image/sampler and/or input attachment).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT or
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL must: only be used as a
    source image of a transfer command (see the definition of
    <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-transfer,
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT>>).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL must: only be used as a
    destination image of a transfer command.
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT usage bit enabled.
ifdef::VK_KHR_swapchain[]
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR must: only be used for presenting
    a presentable image for display.
    A swapchain's image must: be transitioned to this layout before calling
    flink:vkQueuePresentKHR, and must: be transitioned away from this layout
    after calling flink:vkAcquireNextImageKHR.
ifdef::VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image[]
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR is valid only for shared
    presentable images, and must: be used for any usage the image supports.
endif::VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image[]
endif::VK_KHR_swapchain[]

For each mechanism of accessing an image in the API, there is a parameter or
structure member that controls the image layout used to access the image.
For transfer commands, this is a parameter to the command (see <<clears>>
and <<copies>>).
For use as a framebuffer attachment, this is a member in the substructures
of the sname:VkRenderPassCreateInfo (see <<renderpass,Render Pass>>).
For use in a descriptor set, this is a member in the
sname:VkDescriptorImageInfo structure (see <<descriptorsets-updates>>).
At the time that any command buffer command accessing an image executes on
any queue, the layouts of the image subresources that are accessed must: all
match the layout specified via the API controlling those accesses.

The image layout of each image subresource must: be well-defined at each
point in the image subresource's lifetime.
This means that when performing a layout transition on the image
subresource, the old layout value must: either equal the current layout of
the image subresource (at the time the transition executes), or else be
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED (implying that the contents of the image
subresource need not be preserved).
The new layout used in a transition must: not be
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.

[[resources-image-views]]
== Image Views

// refBegin VkImageView Opaque handle to a image view object

Image objects are not directly accessed by pipeline shaders for reading or
writing image data.
Instead, _image views_ representing contiguous ranges of the image
subresources and containing additional metadata are used for that purpose.
Views must: be created on images of compatible types, and must: represent a
valid subset of image subresources.

Image views are represented by sname:VkImageView handles:

include::../api/handles/VkImageView.txt[]

// refEnd VkImageView

// refBegin VkImageViewType Image view types

The types of image views that can: be created are:

include::../api/enums/VkImageViewType.txt[]

The exact image view type is partially implicit, based on the image's type
and sample count, as well as the view creation parameters as described in
the <<resources-image-views-compatibility,image view compatibility table>>
for flink:vkCreateImageView.
This table also shows which SPIR-V code:OpTypeImage code:Dim and
code:Arrayed parameters correspond to each image view type.

// refEnd VkImageViewType

// refBegin vkCreateImageView Create an image view from an existing image

To create an image view, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateImageView.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the image view.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkImageViewCreateInfo structure containing parameters to be used
    to create the image view.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pView points to a sname:VkImageView handle in which the resulting
    image view object is returned.

Some of the image creation parameters are inherited by the view.
The remaining parameters are contained in the pname:pCreateInfo.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateImageView.txt[]

// refBegin VkImageViewCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created image view

The sname:VkImageViewCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageViewCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:image is a sname:VkImage on which the view will be created.
  * pname:viewType is an elink:VkImageViewType value specifying the type of
    the image view.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat describing the format and type used to
    interpret data elements in the image.
  * pname:components is a slink:VkComponentMapping specifies a remapping of
    color components (or of depth or stencil components after they have been
    converted into color components).
  * pname:subresourceRange is a slink:VkImageSubresourceRange selecting the
    set of mipmap levels and array layers to be accessible to the view.

If pname:image was created with the ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT
flag, pname:format can: be different from the image's format, but if they
are not equal they must: be _compatible_.
Image format compatibility is defined in the

// refBegin VkImageSubresourceRange Structure specifying a image subresource range

The sname:VkImageSubresourceRange structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageSubresourceRange.txt[]

  * pname:aspectMask is a bitmask of elink:VkImageAspectFlagBits specifying
    which aspect(s) of the image are included in the view.
  * pname:baseMipLevel is the first mipmap level accessible to the view.
  * pname:levelCount is the number of mipmap levels (starting from
    pname:baseMipLevel) accessible to the view.
  * pname:baseArrayLayer is the first array layer accessible to the view.
  * pname:layerCount is the number of array layers (starting from
    pname:baseArrayLayer) accessible to the view.

The number of mipmap levels and array layers must: be a subset of the image
subresources in the image.
If an application wants to use all mip levels or layers in an image after
the pname:baseMipLevel or pname:baseArrayLayer, it can: set pname:levelCount
and pname:layerCount to the special values ename:VK_REMAINING_MIP_LEVELS and
ename:VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS without knowing the exact number of mip
levels or layers.

For cube and cube array image views, the layers of the image view starting
at pname:baseArrayLayer correspond to faces in the order +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z,
-Z.
For cube arrays, each set of six sequential layers is a single cube, so the
number of cube maps in a cube map array view is _pname:layerCount / 6_, and
image array layer [eq]#(pname:baseArrayLayer {plus} i)# is face index
[eq]#(i mod 6)# of cube _i / 6_.
If the number of layers in the view, whether set explicitly in
pname:layerCount or implied by ename:VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS, is not a
multiple of 6, behavior when indexing the last cube is undefined.

pname:aspectMask must: be only ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT,
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT or ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT if
pname:format is a color, depth-only or stencil-only format, respectively.
If using a depth/stencil format with both depth and stencil components,
pname:aspectMask must: include at least one of
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT and ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT, and
can: include both.

When using an imageView of a depth/stencil image to populate a descriptor
set (e.g. for sampling in the shader, or for use as an input attachment),
the pname:aspectMask must: only include one bit and selects whether the
imageView is used for depth reads (i.e. using a floating-point sampler or
input attachment in the shader) or stencil reads (i.e. using an unsigned
integer sampler or input attachment in the shader).
When an imageView of a depth/stencil image is used as a depth/stencil
framebuffer attachment, the pname:aspectMask is ignored and both depth and
stencil image subresources are used.

The pname:components member is of type slink:VkComponentMapping, and
describes a remapping from components of the image to components of the
vector returned by shader image instructions.
This remapping must: be identity for storage image descriptors, input
attachment descriptors, and framebuffer attachments.

[[resources-association]]
== Resource Memory Association

Resources are initially created as _virtual allocations_ with no backing
memory.
Device memory is allocated separately (see <<memory-device>>) and then
associated with the resource.
This association is done differently for sparse and non-sparse resources.

Resources created with any of the sparse creation flags are considered
sparse resources.
Resources created without these flags are non-sparse.
The details on resource memory association for sparse resources is described
in <<sparsememory>>.

Non-sparse resources must: be bound completely and contiguously to a single
sname:VkDeviceMemory object before the resource is passed as a parameter to
any of the following operations:

  * creating image or buffer views
  * updating descriptor sets
  * recording commands in a command buffer

Once bound, the memory binding is immutable for the lifetime of the
resource.

ifdef::VK_KHX_device_group[]

In a logical device representing more than one physical device, buffer and
image resources exist on all physical devices but can: be bound to memory
differently on each.
Each such replicated resource is an _instance_ of the resource.
For sparse resources, each instance can: be bound to memory arbitrarily
differently.
For non-sparse resources, each instance can: either be bound to the local or
a peer instance of the memory, or for images can: be bound to rectangular
regions from the local and/or peer instances.
When a resource is used in a descriptor set, each physical device interprets
the descriptor according to its own instance's binding to memory.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There are no new copy commands to transfer data between physical devices.
Instead, an application can: create a resource with a peer mapping and use
it as the source or destination of a transfer command executed by a single
physical device to copy the data from one physical device to another.

[[resources-bufferimagegranularity,Buffer-Image Granularity]]
.Buffer-Image Granularity
There is an implementation-dependent limit, pname:bufferImageGranularity,
which specifies a page-like granularity at which linear and non-linear
resources must: be placed in adjacent memory locations to avoid aliasing.
Two resources which do not satisfy this granularity requirement are said to
<<resources-memory-aliasing,alias>>.
pname:bufferImageGranularity is specified in bytes, and must: be a power of
two.
Implementations which do not require such an additional granularity may:
report a value of one.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Despite its name, pname:bufferImageGranularity is really a granularity
between "linear" and "non-linear" resources.
====

Given resourceA at the lower memory offset and resourceB at the higher
memory offset in the same sname:VkDeviceMemory object, where one resource
linear and the other is non-linear (as defined in the
<<glossary-linear-resource,glossary>>), and the following:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
resourceA.end       = resourceA.memoryOffset + resourceA.size - 1
resourceA.endPage   = resourceA.end & ~(bufferImageGranularity-1)
resourceB.start     = resourceB.memoryOffset
resourceB.startPage = resourceB.start & ~(bufferImageGranularity-1)
---------------------------------------------------

The following property must: hold:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
resourceA.endPage < resourceB.startPage
---------------------------------------------------

That is, the end of the first resource (A) and the beginning of the second
resource (B) must: be on separate "`pages`" of size
pname:bufferImageGranularity.
pname:bufferImageGranularity may: be different than the physical page size
of the memory heap.
This restriction is only needed when a linear resource and a non-linear
resource are adjacent in memory and will be used simultaneously.
The memory ranges of adjacent resources can: be closer than
pname:bufferImageGranularity, provided they meet the pname:alignment
requirement for the objects in question.

Sparse block size in bytes and sparse image and buffer memory alignments
must: all be multiples of the pname:bufferImageGranularity.
Therefore, memory bound to sparse resources naturally satisfies the
pname:bufferImageGranularity.

[[resources-sharing]]
== Resource Sharing Mode

// refBegin VkSharingMode Buffer and image sharing modes

Buffer and image objects are created with a _sharing mode_ controlling how
they can: be accessed from queues.
The supported sharing modes are:

include::../api/enums/VkSharingMode.txt[]

  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE specifies that access to any range or
    image subresource of the object will be exclusive to a single queue
    family at a time.
  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT specifies that concurrent access to any
    range or image subresource of the object from multiple queue families is
    supported.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT may: result in lower performance access to
the buffer or image than ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE.
====

Ranges of buffers and image subresources of image objects created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE must: only be accessed by queues in the same
queue family at any given time.
In order for a different queue family to be able to interpret the memory
contents of a range or image subresource, the application must: perform a
<<synchronization-queue-transfers,queue family ownership transfer>>.

Upon creation, resources using ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE are not owned
by any queue family.
A buffer or image memory barrier is not required to acquire _ownership_ when
no queue family owns the resource - it is implicitly acquired upon first use
within a queue.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Images still require a <<resources-image-layouts, layout transition>> from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED
before being used on the first queue.
====

A queue family can: take ownership of an image subresource or buffer range
of a resource created with ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, without an
ownership transfer, in the same way as for a resource that was just created;
however, taking ownership in this way has the effect that the contents of
the image subresource or buffer range are undefined.

Ranges of buffers and image subresources of image objects created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT must: only be accessed by queues from the
queue families specified through the pname:queueFamilyIndexCount and
pname:pQueueFamilyIndices members of the corresponding create info
structures.

// refEnd VkSharingMode


ifdef::VK_KHX_external_memory[]

[[resources-external-sharing]]
=== External Resource Sharing

Resources may only be accessed in the Vulkan instance that has exclusive
ownership of their underlying memory.
Only one Vulkan instance has exclusive ownership of a resource underlying
memory at a given time, regardless of whether the resource was created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE or ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT.
Applications can transfer ownership of a resource's underlying memory only
if the memory has been imported from or exported to another instance or
external API using external memory handles.
The semantics for transferring ownership outside of the instance are similar
to those used for transferring ownership of ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE
resources between queues, and is also accomplished using
slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier or slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier operations.
Applications must:

  . Release exclusive ownership from the source instance or API.
  . Ensure the release operation has completed using semaphores or fences.
  . Acquire exclusive ownership in the destination instance or API

Unlike queue ownership transfers, the destination instance or API is not
specified explicitly when releasing ownership, nor is the source instance or
API specified when acquiring ownership.
Instead, the image or memory barrier's pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex or
pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex parameters are set to the reserved queue family
index ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHX to represent the external
destination or source respectively.

Upon creation, memory objects shared between multiple Vulkan instances or
other APIs are not owned by any instance or API.
The first entity to access them implicitly acquires ownership.
Accessing a resource backed by memory that is owned by a particular instance
or API has the same semantics as accessing a ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE
resource, with one exception: Implementations must: ensure layout
transitions performed on one member of a set of identical subresources of
identical images that alias the same range of an underlying memory object
affect the layout of all the subresources in the set.

endif::VK_KHX_external_memory[]


[[resources-memory-aliasing]]
== Memory Aliasing

A range of a sname:VkDeviceMemory allocation is _aliased_ if it is bound to
multiple resources simultaneously, as described below, via
flink:vkBindImageMemory, flink:vkBindBufferMemory,
ifndef::VK_KHX_external_memory[]
or via <<sparsememory-resource-binding,sparse memory bindings>>.
endif::VK_KHX_external_memory[]
ifdef::VK_KHX_external_memory[]
via <<sparsememory-resource-binding,sparse memory bindings>>, or by binding
the memory to resources in multiple Vulkan instances or external APIs using
external memory handle export and import mechanisms.
endif::VK_KHX_external_memory[]

Consider two resources, resource~A~ and resource~B~, bound respectively to
memory range~A~ and range~B~.
Let paddedRange~A~ and paddedRange~B~ be, respectively, range~A~ and
range~B~ aligned to pname:bufferImageGranularity.
If the resources are both linear or both non-linear (as defined in the
<<glossary-linear-resource,glossary>>), then the resources _alias_ the
memory in the intersection of range~A~ and range~B~.
If one resource is linear and the other is non-linear, then the resources
_alias_ the memory in the intersection of paddedRange~A~ and paddedRange~B~.

Applications can: alias memory, but use of multiple aliases is subject to
several constraints.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Memory aliasing can: be useful to reduce the total device memory footprint
of an application, if some large resources are used for disjoint periods of
time.
====

When an opaque, non-ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT image is
bound to an aliased range, all image subresources of the image _overlap_ the
range.
When a linear image is bound to an aliased range, the image subresources
that (according to the image's advertised layout) include bytes from the
aliased range overlap the range.
When a ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT image has sparse image
blocks bound to an aliased range, only image subresources including those
sparse image blocks overlap the range, and when the memory bound to the
image's mip tail overlaps an aliased range all image subresources in the mip
tail overlap the range.

Buffers, and linear image subresources in either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL
layouts, are _host-accessible subresources_.
That is, the host has a well-defined addressing scheme to interpret the
contents, and thus the layout of the data in memory can: be consistently
interpreted across aliases if each of those aliases is a host-accessible
subresource.
Non-linear images, and linear image subresources in other layouts, are not
host-accessible.

If two aliases are both host-accessible, then they interpret the contents of
the memory in consistent ways, and data written to one alias can: be read by
the other alias.

If either of two aliases is not host-accessible, then the aliases interpret
the contents of the memory differently, and writes via one alias make the
contents of memory partially or completely undefined to the other alias.
If the first alias is a host-accessible subresource, then the bytes affected
are those written by the memory operations according to its addressing
scheme.
If the first alias is not host-accessible, then the bytes affected are those
overlapped by the image subresources that were written.
If the second alias is a host-accessible subresource, the affected bytes
become undefined.
If the second alias is a not host-accessible, all sparse image blocks (for
sparse partially-resident images) or all image subresources (for non-sparse
image and fully resident sparse images) that overlap the affected bytes
become undefined.

If any image subresources are made undefined due to writes to an alias, then
each of those image subresources must: have its layout transitioned from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED to a valid layout before it is used, or from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED if the memory has been written by the
host.
If any sparse blocks of a sparse image have been made undefined, then only
the image subresources containing them must: be transitioned.

Use of an overlapping range by two aliases must: be separated by a memory
dependency using the appropriate <<synchronization-access-types, access
types>> if at least one of those uses performs writes, whether the aliases
interpret memory consistently or not.
If buffer or image memory barriers are used, the scope of the barrier must:
contain the entire range and/or set of image subresources that overlap.

If two aliasing image views are used in the same framebuffer, then the
render pass must: declare the attachments using the
<<renderpass-aliasing,ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT>>, and
follow the other rules listed in that section.

Access to resources which alias memory from shaders using variables
decorated with code:Coherent are not automatically coherent with each other.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Memory recycled via an application suballocator (i.e. without freeing and
reallocating the memory objects) is not substantially different from memory
aliasing.
However, a suballocator usually waits on a fence before recycling a region
of memory, and signaling a fence involves sufficient implicit dependencies
to satisfy all the above requirements.
====
