= Resource Creation

Vulkan supports two primary resource types: _buffers_ and _images_.
Resources are views of memory with associated formatting and dimensionality.
Buffers are essentially unformatted arrays of bytes whereas images contain
format information, can: be multidimensional and may: have associated
metadata.

== Buffers

// refBegin VkBuffer Opaque handle to a buffer object

Buffers represent linear arrays of data which are used for various purposes
by binding them to a graphics or compute pipeline via descriptor sets or via
certain commands, or by directly specifying them as parameters to certain
commands.

Buffers are represented by sname:VkBuffer handles:

include::../api/handles/VkBuffer.txt[]

// refEnd VkBuffer

// refBegin vkCreateBuffer Create a new buffer object

To create buffers, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateBuffer.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the buffer object.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkBufferCreateInfo structure containing parameters affecting
    creation of the buffer.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pBuffer points to a sname:VkBuffer handle in which the resulting
    buffer object is returned.

.Valid Usage
****
  * If the pname:flags member of pname:pCreateInfo includes
    ename:VK_BUFFER_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT, creating this sname:VkBuffer
    must: not cause the total required sparse memory for all currently valid
    sparse resources on the device to exceed
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sparseAddressSpaceSize

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
// (x,y,z,layer) are in texel coordinates
address(x,y,z,layer) = layer*arrayPitch + z*depthPitch + y*rowPitch + x*elementSize + offset

For compressed formats, the pname:rowPitch is the number of bytes between
compressed texel blocks in adjacent rows.
pname:arrayPitch is the number of bytes between compressed texel blocks in
adjacent array layers.
pname:depthPitch is the number of bytes between compressed texel blocks in
adjacent slices of a 3D image.

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
// (x,y,z,layer) are in compressed texel block coordinates
address(x,y,z,layer) = layer*arrayPitch + z*depthPitch + y*rowPitch + x*compressedTexelBlockByteSize + offset;

[[resources-image-layouts]]
== Image Layouts

Images are stored in implementation-dependent opaque layouts in memory.
Implementations may: support several opaque layouts, and the layout used at
any given time is determined by the elink:VkImageLayout state of the image
subresource.
Each layout has limitations on what kinds of operations are supported for
image subresources using the layout.
Applications have control over which layout each image subresource uses, and
can: transition an image subresource from one layout to another.
Transitions can: happen with an image memory barrier, included as part of a
fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier or a fname:vkCmdWaitEvents command buffer command
(see <<synchronization-image-memory-barriers>>), or as part of a subpass
dependency within a render pass (see sname:VkSubpassDependency).
The image layout state is per-image subresource, and separate image
subresources of the same image can: be in different layouts at the same time
with one exception - depth and stencil aspects of a given image subresource
must: always be in the same layout.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Each layout may: offer optimal performance for a specific usage of image
memory.
For example, an image with a layout of
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL may: provide optimal
performance for use as a color attachment, but be unsupported for use in
transfer commands.
Applications can: transition an image subresource from one layout to another
in order to achieve optimal performance when the image subresource is used
for multiple kinds of operations.
After initialization, applications need not use any layout other than the
general layout, though this may: produce suboptimal performance on some
implementations.
====

Upon creation, all image subresources of an image are initially in the same
layout, where that layout is selected by the
sname:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:initialLayout member.
The pname:initialLayout must: be either ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.
If it is ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED, then the image data can: be
preinitialized by the host while using this layout, and the transition away
from this layout will preserve that data.
If it is ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, then the contents of the data are
considered to be undefined, and the transition away from this layout is not
guaranteed to preserve that data.
For either of these initial layouts, any image subresources must: be
transitioned to another layout before they are accessed by the device.

Host access to image memory is only well-defined for images created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR tiling and for image subresources of those
images which are currently in either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL
layout.
Calling flink:vkGetImageSubresourceLayout for a linear image returns a
subresource layout mapping that is valid for either of those image layouts.

// refBegin VkImageLayout Layout of image and image subresources

The set of image layouts consists of:

include::../api/enums/VkImageLayout.txt[]

The type(s) of device access supported by each layout are:

  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED: Supports no device access.
    This layout must: only be used as the pname:initialLayout member of
    sname:VkImageCreateInfo or sname:VkAttachmentDescription, or as the
    pname:oldLayout in an image transition.
    When transitioning out of this layout, the contents of the memory are
    not guaranteed to be preserved.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED: Supports no device access.
    This layout must: only be used as the pname:initialLayout member of
    sname:VkImageCreateInfo or sname:VkAttachmentDescription, or as the
    pname:oldLayout in an image transition.
    When transitioning out of this layout, the contents of the memory are
    preserved.
    This layout is intended to be used as the initial layout for an image
    whose contents are written by the host, and hence the data can: be
    written to memory immediately, without first executing a layout
    transition.
    Currently, ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED is only useful with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR images because there is not a standard
    layout defined for ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL images.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL: Supports all types of device access.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    color or resolve attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL: must: only be
    used as a depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.

    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL: must: only be
    used as a read-only depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer
    and/or as a read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled
    image, combined image/sampler and/or input attachment).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT usage bit enabled.
    Only image subresources of images created with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT can: be used as sampled image or
    combined image/sampler in a shader.
    Similarly, only image subresources of images created with
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT can: be used as input
    attachments.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a
    read-only image in a shader (which can: be read as a sampled image,
    combined image/sampler and/or input attachment).

    source image of a transfer command (see the definition of
    <<synchronization-pipeline-stages-transfer,
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT>>).
    This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
    the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT usage bit enabled.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL: must: only be used as a

endif::VK_KHR_swapchain[]

For each mechanism of accessing an image in the API, there is a parameter or
structure member that controls the image layout used to access the image.
For transfer commands, this is a parameter to the command (see <<clears>>
and <<copies>>).
For use as a framebuffer attachment, this is a member in the substructures
of the sname:VkRenderPassCreateInfo (see <<renderpass,Render Pass>>).
For use in a descriptor set, this is a member in the
sname:VkDescriptorImageInfo structure (see <<descriptorsets-updates>>).
At the time that any command buffer command accessing an image executes on
any queue, the layouts of the image subresources that are accessed must: all
match the layout specified via the API controlling those accesses.

The image layout of each image subresource must: be well-defined at each
point in the image subresource's lifetime.
This means that when performing a layout transition on the image
subresource, the old layout value must: either equal the current layout of
the image subresource (at the time the transition executes), or else be
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED (implying that the contents of the image
subresource need not be preserved).
The new layout used in a transition must: not be
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.

== Image Views

// refBegin VkImageView Opaque handle to a image view object

Image objects are not directly accessed by pipeline shaders for reading or
writing image data.
Instead, _image views_ representing contiguous ranges of the image
subresources and containing additional metadata are used for that purpose.
Views must: be created on images of compatible types, and must: represent a
valid subset of image subresources.

Image views are represented by sname:VkImageView handles:

include::../api/handles/VkImageView.txt[]

// refEnd VkImageView

// refBegin VkImageViewType Image view types

The types of image views that can: be created are:

include::../api/enums/VkImageViewType.txt[]

The exact image view type is partially implicit, based on the image's type
and sample count, as well as the view creation parameters as described in
the <<resources-image-views-compatibility,table below>>.
This table also shows which SPIR-V OpTypeImage Dim and Arrayed parameters
correspond to each image view type.

// refEnd VkImageViewType

// refBegin vkCreateImageView Create an image view from an existing image

To create an image view, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateImageView.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the image view.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkImageViewCreateInfo structure containing parameters to be used
    to create the image view.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pView points to a sname:VkImageView handle in which the resulting
    image view object is returned.

Some of the image creation parameters are inherited by the view.
The remaining parameters are contained in the pname:pCreateInfo.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateImageView.txt[]

// refBegin VkImageViewCreateInfo Structure specifying parameters of a newly created image view

The sname:VkImageViewCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageViewCreateInfo.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:image is a sname:VkImage on which the view will be created.
  * pname:viewType is the type of the image view.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat describing the format and type used to
    interpret data elements in the image.
  * pname:components specifies a remapping of color components (or of depth
    or stencil components after they have been converted into color
    components).
    See slink:VkComponentMapping.
  * pname:subresourceRange is a slink:VkImageSubresourceRange selecting the
    set of mipmap levels and array layers to be accessible to the view.

If pname:image was created with the ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT
flag, pname:format can: be different from the image's format, but if they
are not equal they must: be _compatible_.
Image format compatibility is defined in the
<<features-formats-compatibility-classes,Format Compatibility Classes>>
section.

// refBegin VkImageSubresourceRange Structure specifying a image subresource range

The sname:VkImageSubresourceRange structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageSubresourceRange.txt[]

  * pname:aspectMask is a bitmask indicating which aspect(s) of the image
    are included in the view.
    See elink:VkImageAspectFlagBits.
  * pname:baseMipLevel is the first mipmap level accessible to the view.
  * pname:levelCount is the number of mipmap levels (starting from
    pname:baseMipLevel) accessible to the view.
  * pname:baseArrayLayer is the first array layer accessible to the view.
  * pname:layerCount is the number of array layers (starting from
    pname:baseArrayLayer) accessible to the view.

The number of mipmap levels and array layers must: be a subset of the image
subresources in the image.
If an application wants to use all mip levels or layers in an image after
the pname:baseMipLevel or pname:baseArrayLayer, it can: set pname:levelCount
and pname:layerCount to the special values ename:VK_REMAINING_MIP_LEVELS and
ename:VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS without knowing the exact number of mip
levels or layers.

For cube and cube array image views, the layers of the image view starting
at pname:baseArrayLayer correspond to faces in the order +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z,
-Z.
For cube arrays, each set of six sequential layers is a single cube, so the
number of cube maps in a cube map array view is _pname:layerCount / 6_, and
image array layer _pname:baseArrayLayer + i_ is face index _i mod 6_ of cube
_i / 6_.
If the number of layers in the view, whether set explicitly in
pname:layerCount or implied by ename:VK_REMAINING_ARRAY_LAYERS, is not a
multiple of 6, behavior when indexing the last cube is undefined.

pname:aspectMask is a bitmask indicating the format being used.
Bits which may: be set include:

// refBegin VkImageAspectFlagBits Bitmask specifying which aspects of an image are included in a view
include::../api/enums/VkImageAspectFlagBits.txt[]

The mask must: be only ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT,
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT or ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT if
pname:format is a color, depth-only or stencil-only format, respectively.
If using a depth/stencil format with both depth and stencil components,
pname:aspectMask must: include at least one of
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT and ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT, and
can: include both.

When using an imageView of a depth/stencil image to populate a descriptor
set (e.g. for sampling in the shader, or for use as an input attachment),
the pname:aspectMask must: only include one bit and selects whether the
imageView is used for depth reads (i.e. using a floating-point sampler or
input attachment in the shader) or stencil reads (i.e. using an unsigned
integer sampler or input attachment in the shader).
When an imageView of a depth/stencil image is used as a depth/stencil
framebuffer attachment, the pname:aspectMask is ignored and both depth and
stencil image subresources are used.

The pname:components member is of type slink:VkComponentMapping, and
describes a remapping from components of the image to components of the
vector returned by shader image instructions.
This remapping must: be identity for storage image descriptors, input
attachment descriptors, and framebuffer attachments.

[[resources-association]]
== Resource Memory Association

Resources are initially created as _virtual allocations_ with no backing
memory.
Device memory is allocated separately (see <<memory-device>>) and then
associated with the resource.
This association is done differently for sparse and non-sparse resources.

Resources created with any of the sparse creation flags are considered
sparse resources.
Resources created without these flags are non-sparse.
The details on resource memory association for sparse resources is described
in <<sparsememory>>.

Non-sparse resources must: be bound completely and contiguously to a single
sname:VkDeviceMemory object before the resource is passed as a parameter to
any of the following operations:

  * creating image or buffer views
  * updating descriptor sets
  * recording commands in a command buffer

Once bound, the memory binding is immutable for the lifetime of the
resource.

// refBegin vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements Returns the memory requirements for specified Vulkan object

  * pname:alignment is the alignment, in bytes, of the offset within the
    allocation required: for the resource.
  * pname:memoryTypeBits is a bitmask and contains one bit set for every
    supported memory type for the resource.
    Bit `i` is set if and only if the memory type `i` in the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure for the physical device
    is supported for the resource.

include::../validity/structs/VkMemoryRequirements.txt[]

The implementation guarantees certain properties about the memory
requirements returned by flink:vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements and
flink:vkGetImageMemoryRequirements:

  * The pname:memoryTypeBits member always contains at least one bit set.
  * If pname:buffer is a sname:VkBuffer not created with the
    ename:VK_BUFFER_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT bit set, or if pname:image is
    a sname:VkImage that was created with a ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR
    value in the pname:tiling member of the sname:VkImageCreateInfo
    structure passed to fname:vkCreateImage, then the pname:memoryTypeBits
    member always contains at least one bit set corresponding to a
    sname:VkMemoryType with a pname:propertyFlags that has both the
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT bit and the
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bit set.
    In other words, mappable coherent memory can: always be attached to
    these objects.
  * The pname:memoryTypeBits member always contains at least one bit set
    corresponding to a sname:VkMemoryType with a pname:propertyFlags that
    has the ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT bit set.
  * The pname:memoryTypeBits member is identical for all sname:VkBuffer
    objects created with the same value for the pname:flags and pname:usage
    members in the sname:VkBufferCreateInfo structure passed to
    fname:vkCreateBuffer.
    Further, if code:usage1 and code:usage2 of type elink:VkBufferUsageFlags
    are such that the bits set in code:usage2 are a subset of the bits set
    in code:usage1, and they have the same pname:flags, then the bits set in
    pname:memoryTypeBits returned for code:usage1 must: be a subset of the
    bits set in pname:memoryTypeBits returned for code:usage2, for all
    values of pname:flags.
  * The pname:alignment member is a power of two.
  * The pname:alignment member is identical for all sname:VkBuffer objects
    created with the same combination of values for the pname:usage and
    pname:flags members in the sname:VkBufferCreateInfo structure passed to
    fname:vkCreateBuffer.
  * For images created with a color format, the pname:memoryTypeBits member
    is identical for all sname:VkImage objects created with the same
    combination of values for the pname:tiling member, the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT bit of the pname:flags member,
    and the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT of the pname:usage
    member in the sname:VkImageCreateInfo structure passed to
    fname:vkCreateImage.
  * For images created with a depth/stencil format, the pname:memoryTypeBits
    member is identical for all sname:VkImage objects created with the same
    combination of values for the pname:format member, the pname:tiling
    member, the ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT bit of the
    pname:flags member, and the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT of the pname:usage member
    in the sname:VkImageCreateInfo structure passed to fname:vkCreateImage.
  * If the memory requirements are for a sname:VkImage, the
    pname:memoryTypeBits member must: not refer to a sname:VkMemoryType with
    a pname:propertyFlags that has the
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT bit set if the

[[resources-bufferimagegranularity,Buffer-Image Granularity]]
.Buffer-Image Granularity
There is an implementation-dependent limit, pname:bufferImageGranularity,
which specifies a page-like granularity at which buffer, linear image and
optimal image resources must: be placed in adjacent memory locations to
avoid aliasing.
Two resources which do not satisfy this granularity requirement are said to
<<resources-memory-aliasing,alias>>.
Linear image resource are images created with ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR
and optimal image resources are those created with
ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL.
pname:bufferImageGranularity is specified in bytes, and must: be a power of
two.
Implementations which do not require such an additional granularity may:
report a value of one.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
pname:bufferImageGranularity is really a granularity between "linear"
resources, including buffers and images with linear tiling, vs.
"optimal" resources, i.e. images with optimal tiling.
It would have been better named "linearOptimalGranularity".
====

Given resourceA at the lower memory offset and resourceB at the higher
memory offset in the same sname:VkDeviceMemory object, where one of the
resources is a buffer or a linear image and the other is an optimal image,
and the following:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
resourceA.end       = resourceA.memoryOffset + resourceA.size - 1
resourceA.endPage   = resourceA.end & ~(bufferImageGranularity-1)
resourceB.start     = resourceB.memoryOffset
resourceB.startPage = resourceB.start & ~(bufferImageGranularity-1)
---------------------------------------------------

The following property must: hold:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
resourceA.endPage < resourceB.startPage
---------------------------------------------------

That is, the end of the first resource (A) and the beginning of the second
resource (B) must: be on separate "`pages`" of size
pname:bufferImageGranularity.
pname:bufferImageGranularity may: be different than the physical page size
of the memory heap.
This restriction is only needed when a buffer or a linear image is at
adjacent memory location with an optimal image and both will be used
simultaneously.
Adjacent buffers' or adjacent images' memory ranges can: be closer than
pname:bufferImageGranularity, provided they meet the pname:alignment
requirement for the objects in question.

Sparse block size in bytes and sparse image and buffer memory alignments
must: all be multiples of the pname:bufferImageGranularity.
Therefore, memory bound to sparse resources naturally satisfies the
pname:bufferImageGranularity.

[[resources-sharing]]
== Resource Sharing Mode

// refBegin VkSharingMode Buffer and image sharing modes

Buffer and image objects are created with a _sharing mode_ controlling how
they can: be accessed from queues.
The supported sharing modes are:

include::../api/enums/VkSharingMode.txt[]

  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE specifies that access to any range or
    image subresource of the object will be exclusive to a single queue
    family at a time.
  * ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT specifies that concurrent access to any
    range or image subresource of the object from multiple queue families is
    supported.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT may: result in lower performance access to
the buffer or image than ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE.
====

Ranges of buffers and image subresources of image objects created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE must: only be accessed by queues in the same
queue family at any given time.
In order for a different queue family to be able to interpret the memory
contents of a range or image subresource, the application must: perform a
<<synchronization-queue-transfers,queue family ownership transfer>>.

Upon creation, resources using ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE are not owned
by any queue family.
A buffer or image memory barrier is not required to acquire _ownership_ when
no queue family owns the resource - it is implicitly acquired upon first use
within a queue.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Images still require a <<resources-image-layouts, layout transition>> from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED
before being used on the first queue.
====

A queue family can: take ownership of an image subresource or buffer range
of a resource created with ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, without an
ownership transfer, in the same way as for a resource that was just created;
however, taking ownership in this way has the effect that the contents of
the image subresource or buffer range are undefined.

Ranges of buffers and image subresources of image objects created using
ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT must: only be accessed by queues from the
queue families specified through the pname:queueFamilyIndexCount and
pname:pQueueFamilyIndices members of the corresponding create info
structures.

// refEnd VkSharingMode


[[resources-memory-aliasing]]
== Memory Aliasing

A range of a sname:VkDeviceMemory allocation is _aliased_ if it is bound to
multiple resources simultaneously, via flink:vkBindImageMemory,
flink:vkBindBufferMemory, or via <<sparsememory-resource-binding,sparse
memory bindings>>.
A memory range aliased between two images or two buffers is defined to be
the intersection of the memory ranges bound to the two resources.
A memory range aliased between two resources where one is a buffer or a
linear image, and the other is an optimal image, is defined to be the
intersection of the memory ranges bound to the two resources, where each
range is first padded to be aligned to the pname:bufferImageGranularity.
Applications can: alias memory, but use of multiple aliases is subject to
several constraints.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Memory aliasing can: be useful to reduce the total device memory footprint
of an application, if some large resources are used for disjoint periods of
time.
====

When an opaque, non-ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT image is
bound to an aliased range, all image subresources of the image _overlap_ the
range.
When a linear image is bound to an aliased range, the image subresources
that (according to the image's advertised layout) include bytes from the
aliased range overlap the range.
When a ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT image has sparse image
blocks bound to an aliased range, only image subresources including those
sparse image blocks overlap the range, and when the memory bound to the
image's mip tail overlaps an aliased range all image subresources in the mip
tail overlap the range.

Buffers, and linear image subresources in either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL
layouts, are _host-accessible subresources_.
That is, the host has a well-defined addressing scheme to interpret the
contents, and thus the layout of the data in memory can: be consistently
interpreted across aliases if each of those aliases is a host-accessible
subresource.
Opaque images and linear image subresources in other layouts are not
host-accessible.

If two aliases are both host-accessible, then they interpret the contents of
the memory in consistent ways, and data written to one alias can: be read by
the other alias.

If either of two aliases is not host-accessible, then the aliases interpret
the contents of the memory differently, and writes via one alias make the
contents of memory partially or completely undefined to the other alias.
If the first alias is a host-accessible subresource, then the bytes affected
are those written by the memory operations according to its addressing
scheme.
If the first alias is not host-accessible, then the bytes affected are those
overlapped by the image subresources that were written.
If the second alias is a host-accessible subresource, the affected bytes
become undefined.
If the second alias is a not host-accessible, all sparse image blocks (for
sparse partially-resident images) or all image subresources (for non-sparse
image and fully resident sparse images) that overlap the affected bytes
become undefined.

If any image subresources are made undefined due to writes to an alias, then
each of those image subresources must: have its layout transitioned from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED to a valid layout before it is used, or from
ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED if the memory has been written by the
host.
If any sparse blocks of a sparse image have been made undefined, then only
the image subresources containing them must: be transitioned.

Use of an overlapping range by two aliases must: be separated by a memory
dependency using the appropriate <<synchronization-access-types, access
types>> if at least one of those uses performs writes, whether the aliases
interpret memory consistently or not.
If buffer or image memory barriers are used, the scope of the barrier must:
contain the entire range and/or set of image subresources that overlap.

If two aliasing image views are used in the same framebuffer, then the
render pass must: declare the attachments using the
<<renderpass-aliasing,ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT>>, and
follow the other rules listed in that section.

Access to resources which alias memory from shaders using variables
decorated with code:Coherent are not automatically coherent with each other.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Memory recycled via an application suballocator (i.e. without freeing and
reallocating the memory objects) is not substantially different from memory
aliasing.
However, a suballocator usually waits on a fence before recycling a region
of memory, and signaling a fence involves sufficient implicit dependencies
to satisfy all the above requirements.
====
