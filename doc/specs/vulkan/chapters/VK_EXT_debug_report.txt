== Debug Report Callbacks

// refBegin VkDebugReportCallbackEXT Opaque handle to a debug report callback object

Debug report callbacks are represented by sname:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT
handles:

include::../api/handles/VkDebugReportCallbackEXT.txt[]

// refEnd VkDebugReportCallbackEXT

// refBegin vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT Create a debug report callback object

Debug report callbacks give more detailed feedback on the application's use
of Vulkan when events of interest occur.

To register a debug report callback, an application uses
flink:vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT.

include::../api/protos/vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT.txt[]

  * pname:instance the instance the callback will be logged on.
  * pname:pCreateInfo points to a slink:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT
    structure which defines the conditions under which this callback will be
    called.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pCallback is a pointer to record the
    sname:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT object created.

include::../validity/protos/vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT.txt[]

// refBegin VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT Structure specifying parameters of a newly created debug report callback

The definition of slink:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT is:

include::../api/structs/VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT specifying
    which event(s) will cause this callback to be called.
  * pname:pfnCallback is the application callback function to call.
  * pname:pUserData is user data to be passed to the callback.

For each sname:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT that is created the
sname:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT::pname:flags determine when that
sname:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT::pname:pfnCallback is called.
When an event happens, the implementation will do a bitwise AND of the
event's elink:VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT flags to each
sname:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT object's flags.
For each non-zero result the corresponding callback will be called.
The callback will come directly from the component that detected the event,
unless some other layer intercepts the calls for its own purposes (filter
them in a different way, log to a system error log, etc.).

An application may: receive multiple callbacks if multiple
sname:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT objects were created.
A callback will always be executed in the same thread as the originating
Vulkan call.

A callback may be called from multiple threads simultaneously (if the
application is making Vulkan calls from multiple threads).

include::../validity/structs/VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT.txt[]

// refBegin VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT Bitmask specifying events which cause a debug report callback

Bits which can: be set in
slink:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT::pname:flags, specifying events
which cause a debug report, are:

include::../api/enums/VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT.txt[]

  * ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_ERROR_BIT_EXT specifies that an error that may
    cause undefined results, including an application crash.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_WARNING_BIT_EXT specifies use of Vulkan that may:
    expose an app bug.
    Such cases may not be immediately harmful, such as a fragment shader
    outputting to a location with no attachment.
    Other cases may: point to behavior that is almost certainly bad when
    unintended such as using an image whose memory has not been filled.
    In general if you see a warning but you know that the behavior is
    intended/desired, then simply ignore the warning.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_PERFORMANCE_WARNING_BIT_EXT specifies a
    potentially non-optimal use of Vulkan, e.g. using
    flink:vkCmdClearColorImage when setting
    slink:VkAttachmentDescription::pname:loadOp to
    ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR would have worked.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_INFORMATION_BIT_EXT specifies an informational
    message such as resource details that may be handy when debugging an
    application.
  * ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_DEBUG_BIT_EXT specifies diagnostic information
    from the implementation and layers.

// refEnd VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT

// refBegin PFN_vkDebugReportCallbackEXT Application-defined debug report callback function

The prototype for the
slink:VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT::pname:pfnCallback function
implemented by the application is:

include::../api/funcpointers/PFN_vkDebugReportCallbackEXT.txt[]

  * pname:flags indicates the elink:VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT that triggered
    this callback.
  * pname:objectType is a elink:VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT value specifying
    the type of object being used or created at the time the event was
    triggered.
  * pname:object is the object where the issue was detected.
    If pname:objectType is ename:VK_DEBUG_REPORT_OBJECT_TYPE_UNKNOWN_EXT,
    pname:object is undefined.
  * pname:location is a component (layer, driver, loader) defined value that
    indicates the _location_ of the trigger.
    This is an optional value.
  * pname:messageCode is a layer-defined value indicating what test
    triggered this callback.
  * pname:pLayerPrefix is a null-terminated string that is an abbreviation
    of the name of the component making the callback.
    pname:pLayerPrefix is only valid for the duration of the callback.
  * pname:pMessage is a null-terminated string detailing the trigger
    conditions.
    pname:pMessage is only valid for the duration of the callback.
  * pname:pUserData is the user data given when the
    slink:VkDebugReportCallbackEXT was created.

The callback must: not call fname:vkDestroyDebugReportCallbackEXT.

The callback returns a basetype:VkBool32 that indicates to the calling layer
the application's desire to abort the call.
A value of ename:VK_TRUE indicates that the application wants to abort this
call.
If the application returns ename:VK_FALSE, the command must: not be aborted.
Applications should: always return ename:VK_FALSE so that they see the same
behavior with and without validation layers enabled.

If the application returns ename:VK_TRUE from its callback and the Vulkan
call being aborted returns a elink:VkResult, the layer will return
ename:VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED_EXT.

// refEnd PFN_vkDebugReportCallbackEXT

// refBegin VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT Specify the type of an object handle

Possible values passed to the pname:objectType parameter of the callback
function specified by

====
The primary expected use of ename:VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED_EXT is for
validation layer testing.
It is not expected that an application would see this error code during
normal use of the validation layers.

// refEnd PFN_vkDebugReportCallbackEXT

// refBegin vkDebugReportMessageEXT Inject a message into a debug stream

To inject its own messages into the debug stream, call:

include::../api/protos/vkDebugReportMessageEXT.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the debug stream's sname:VkInstance.
  * pname:flags indicates the elink:VkDebugReportFlagBitsEXT classification
    of this event/message.
  * pname:objectType is a elink:VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT specifying the
    type of object being used or created at the time the event was
    triggered.
  * pname:object this is the object where the issue was detected.
    pname:object can: be ename:VK_NULL_HANDLE if there is no object
    associated with the event.

  * pname:pLayerPrefix is the abbreviation of the component making this
    event/message.

    conditions.

The call will propagate through the layers and generate callback(s) as
indicated by the message's flags.
The parameters are passed on to the callback in addition to the
pname:pUserData value that was defined at the time the callback was
registered.
