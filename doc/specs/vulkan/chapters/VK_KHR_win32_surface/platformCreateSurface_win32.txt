=== Win32 Platform

// refBegin vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Win32 native window

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a Win32 window, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

include::../../validity/protos/vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR.txt[]

// refBegin VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created Win32 surface object

The sname:VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:hinstance and pname:hwnd are the Win32 code:HINSTANCE and
    code:HWND for the window to associate the surface with.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-hinstance-01307]] pname:hinstance must: be a valid Win32 code:HINSTANCE.
  * [[VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-hwnd-01308]] pname:hwnd must: be a valid Win32 code:HWND.
****

include::../../validity/structs/VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

With Win32, pname:minImageExtent, pname:maxImageExtent, and
pname:currentExtent are the window size.
Therefore, a swapchain's pname:imageExtent must: match the window's size.
