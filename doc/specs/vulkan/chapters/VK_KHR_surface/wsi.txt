= Window System Integration (WSI)

This chapter discusses the window system integration (WSI) between the
{apiname} API and the various forms of displaying the results of rendering to a
user.  Since the {apiname} API can: be used without displaying results, WSI is
provided through the use of optional {apiname} extensions.  This chapter
provides an overview of WSI.  See the appendix for additional details of each
WSI extension, including which extensions must: be enabled in order to use each
of the functions described in this chapter.


== WSI Platform

A platform is an abstraction for a window system, OS, etc.  Some examples
include MS Windows, Android, and Wayland.  The {apiname} API may: be integrated
in a unique manner for each platform.

The {apiname} API does not define any type of platform object.
Platform-specific WSI extensions are defined, which contain platform-specific
functions for using WSI.  Use of these extensions is guarded by preprocessor
symbols.

include::../VK_KHR_xcb_surface/platformCpp_xcb.txt[]
include::../VK_KHR_xlib_surface/platformCpp_xlib.txt[]


In order for an application to be compiled to use WSI with a given platform, it
can: #define the appropriate preprocessor symbol prior including the "vulkan.h"
header file.  Each platform-specific extension is an instance extension; and
the application must: enable instance extensions with fname:vkCreateInstance
before using them.


== WSI Surface

A sname:VkSurfaceKHR object abstracts a native platform surface or window
object for use with {apiname}.  The VK_KHR_surface extension declares the
sname:VkSurfaceKHR object, and provides a function for destroying
sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects.  Separate platform-specific extensions each provide
a function for creating a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for the respective
platform.  From the application's perspective this is an opaque handle, just
like the handles of other {apiname} objects.

ifdef::implementation-guide[]
[NOTE]
.Note
====
On certain platforms, the {apiname} loader and ICDs
may: have conventions that treat the handle as a pointer to a struct that
contains the platform-specific information about the surface. This will
be described in the documentation for the loader-ICD interface, and in the
"vk_icd.h" header file of the LoaderAndTools source-code repository.
This does not affect the loader-layer interface; layers may: wrap
sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects.

=== Platform-Independent Information

Once created, sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects can: be used in this and other
extensions, in particular the VK_KHR_swapchain extension.

Several WSI functions return ename:VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR if the surface
becomes no longer available.  After such an error, the surface (and any child
swapchain, if one exists) should: be destroyed, as there is no way to restore
them to a not-lost state.  Applications may: attempt to create a new
sname:VkSurfaceKHR using the same native platform window object, but whether
such re-creation will succeed is platform-dependent and may: depend on the
reason the surface became unavailable. A lost surface does not otherwise cause
devices to be <<devsandqueues-lost-device,lost>>.

To destroy a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object, call:

include::../../protos/vkDestroySurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance used to create the surface.
  * pname:surface is the surface to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).

Destroying a sname:VkSurfaceKHR merely severs the connection between {apiname}
and the native surface, and doesn't imply destroying the native surface,
closing a window, or similar behavior.

== Querying for WSI Support

Not all physical devices will include WSI support.  Within a physical device,
not all queue families will support presentation.  WSI support and
compatibility can: be determined in a platform-neutral manner (which
determines support for presentation to a particular surface object) and
additionally may: be determined in platform-specific manners (which determine
support for presentation on the specified physical device but don't guarantee
support for presentation to a particular surface object).

To determine whether a queue family of a physical device supports presentation
to a given surface, call:

include::../../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex is the queue family.
  * pname:surface is the surface.
  * pname:pSupported is a pointer to a basetype:VkBool32, which is set to
    ename:VK_TRUE to indicate support, and ename:VK_FALSE otherwise.

== Surface Queries

To query the basic capabilities of a surface, needed in order to create a
swapchain, call:

include::../../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pSurfaceCapabilities is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure that will be filled with
    information.

include::../../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

The definition of sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR is:

include::../../structs/VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:minImageCount is the minimum number of images the specified device
    supports for a swapchain created for the surface.
  * pname:maxImageCount is the maximum number of images the specified device
    supports for a swapchain created for the surface.  A value of `0` means
    that there is no limit on the number of images, though there may: be
    limits related to the total amount of memory used by swapchain images.
  * pname:currentExtent is the current width and height of the surface, or
    the special value latexmath:[$(0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF)$] indicating that
    the surface size will be determined by the extent of a swapchain
    targeting the surface.
  * pname:minImageExtent contains the smallest valid swapchain extent for
    the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:maxImageExtent contains the largest valid swapchain extent for
    the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:maxImageArrayLayers is the maximum number of layers swapchain
    images can: have for a swapchain created for this device and surface.
  * pname:supportedTransforms is a bitfield of
    elink:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, describing the
    presentation transforms supported for the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:currentTransform is a bitfield of
    elink:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, describing the surface's current
    transform relative to the presentation engine's natural orientation.
  * pname:supportedCompositeAlpha is a bitfield of
    elink:VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR, representing the
    alpha compositing modes supported by the presentation engine for the
    surface on the specified device.  Opaque composition can: be achieved in
    any alpha compositing mode by either using a swapchain image format that
    has no alpha component, or by ensuring that all pixels in the swapchain
    images have an alpha value of 1.0.
  * pname:supportedUsageFlags is a bitfield of elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits
    representing the ways the application can: use the
    presentable images of a swapchain created for the surface on the specified
    device.  ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT must: be included in
    the set but implementations may: support additional usages.

include::../../validity/structs/VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]

The pname:supportedTransforms and pname:currentTransform members are of type
ename:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, which contains the following values:

include::../../enums/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.txt[]

These values are described as follows:

    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR: The image content is
      presented without being transformed.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_90_BIT_KHR: The image content is
      rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_180_BIT_KHR: The image content is
      rotated 180 degrees clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_270_BIT_KHR: The image content is
      rotated 270 degrees clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_BIT_KHR: The image content
      is mirrored horizontally.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_90_BIT_KHR: The
      image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 90 degrees
      clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_180_BIT_KHR: The
      image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 180 degrees
      clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_270_BIT_KHR: The
      image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 270 degrees
      clockwise.
    - ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_INHERIT_BIT_KHR: The presentation transform
      is not specified, and is instead determined by platform-specific
      considerations and mechanisms outside {apiname}.

The pname:supportedCompositeAlpha member is of type
ename:VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR, which contains the following values:

include::../../enums/VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR.txt[]

These values are described as follows:

    - ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel, if it
      exists, of the images is ignored in the compositing process.  Instead,
      the image is treated as if it has a constant alpha of 1.0.
    - ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_PRE_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel, if
      it exists, of the images is respected in the compositing process.  The
      non-alpha channels of the image are expected to already be multiplied by
      the alpha channel by the application.
    - ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_POST_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel, if
      it exists, of the images is respected in the compositing process.  The
      non-alpha channels of the image are not expected to already be multiplied
      by the alpha channel by the application; instead, the compositor will
      multiply the non-alpha channels of the image by the alpha channel during
      compositing.
    - ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR: The way in which the
      presentation engine treats the alpha channel in the images is unknown to
      the Vulkan API.  Instead, the application is responsible for setting the
      composite alpha blending mode using native window system commands.  If
      the application does not set the blending mode using native window system
      commands, then a platform-specific default will be used.

To query the supported swapchain format-colorspace pairs for a surface, call:

include::../../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pSurfaceFormatCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of format pairs available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pSurfaceFormats is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of sname:VkSurfaceFormatKHR structures.

If pname:pSurfaceFormats is `NULL`, then the number of format pairs
supported for the given pname:surface is returned in
pname:pSurfaceFormatCount. Otherwise, pname:pSurfaceFormatCount must: point
to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the
pname:pSurfaceFormats array, and on return the variable is overwritten with
the number of structures actually written to pname:pSurfaceFormats. If the
value of pname:pSurfaceFormatCount is less than the number of queue families
supported, at most pname:pSurfaceFormatCount structures will be written.

include::../../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR.txt[]

The definition of sname:VkSurfaceFormatKHR is:

include::../../structs/VkSurfaceFormatKHR.txt[]

  * pname:format is a sname:VkFormat that is compatible with the specified
    surface.
  * pname:colorSpace is a presentation ename:VkColorSpaceKHR that is compatible
    with the surface.

include::../../validity/structs/VkSurfaceFormatKHR.txt[]

While the pname:format of a presentable image refers to the
encoding of each pixel, the pname:colorspace
determines how the the presentation engine interprets the pixel values.  A
colorspace in this document refers to a specific combination of color model
(i.e. RGB, YUV, HSL etc.), the actual colorspace (defined by the
chromaticities of its primaries and a whitepoint in CIE Lab), and a transfer
function that is applied before storing or transmitting color data in the
given colorspace.

The ename:VkColorSpaceKHR is defined as follows:

include::../../enums/VkColorSpaceKHR.txt[]

  * ename:VK_COLORSPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR:  The presentation engine supports
    the sRGB colorspace.

To query the supported presentation modes for a surface, call:

include::../../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pPresentModeCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of format pairs available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPresentModes is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of sname:VkPresentModeKHR structures.

If pname:pPresentModes is `NULL`, then the number of presentation modes
supported for the given pname:surface is returned in
pname:pPresentModeCount. Otherwise, pname:pPresentModeCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the
pname:pPresentModes array, and on return the variable is overwritten with
the number of structures actually written to pname:pPresentModes. If the
value of pname:pPresentModeCount is less than the number of presentation
modes supported, at most pname:pPresentModeCount structures will be written.

include::../../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR.txt[]

The definition of ename:VkPresentModeKHR is:

include::../../enums/VkPresentModeKHR.txt[]

  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR: The presentation engine does not wait
    for a vertical blanking period to update the current image, meaning this
    mode may: result in visible tearing.  No internal queuing of
    presentation requests is needed, as the requests are applied immediately.
  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR: The presentation engine waits for the
    next vertical blanking period to update the current image.  Tearing cannot:
    be observed.  An internal single-entry queue is used to hold pending
    presentation requests.  If the queue is full when a new presentation
    request is received, the new request replaces the existing entry, and any
    images associated with the prior entry become available for re-use by the
    application.  One request is removed from the queue and processed during
    each vertical blanking period in which the queue is non-empty.
  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR: The presentation engine waits for the next
    vertical blanking period to update the current image.  Tearing cannot: be
    observed.  An internal queue containing (numSwapchainImages - 1) entries,
    where numSwapchainImages is the number of presentable images in the
    swapchain, is used to hold pending presentation requests.  New
    requests are appended to the end of the queue, and one request is removed
    from the beginning of the queue and processed during each vertical blanking
    period in which the queue is non-empty.  This is the only value of
    pname:presentMode that is required: to be supported.
  * ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR: The presentation engine waits for
    the next vertical blanking period to update the current image.  If
    a vertical blanking period has already passed since the last update
    of the current image then the presentation engine does not wait for
    another vertical blanking period for the update, meaning this mode
    may: result in visible tearing in this case.  An internal queue
    containing latexmath:[$\mathit{numSwapchainImages} - 1$] entries, where
    pname:numSwapchainImages is the number of presentable images in the
    swapchain, is used to hold pending presentation requests.
    New requests are appended to the end of the queue, and one request
    is removed from the beginning of the queue and processed during or
    after each vertical blanking period in which the queue is
    non-empty.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For reference, the mode indicated by ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR is
equivalent to the behavior of {wgl|glX|egl}SwapBuffers with a swap interval
of 1, while the mode indicated by ename:VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR is
equivalent to the behavior of {wgl|glX|egl}SwapBuffers with a swap internal
of -1.
