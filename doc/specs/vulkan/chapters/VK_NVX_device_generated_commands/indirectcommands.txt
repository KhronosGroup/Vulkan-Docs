== Indirect Commands Layout

// refBegin VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX Opaque handle to an indirect commands layout object

The device-side command generation happens through an iterative processing
of an atomic sequence comprised of command tokens, which are represented by:

include::../../api/handles/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX.txt[]

// refEnd VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX


=== Tokenized Command Processing

The processing is in principle illustrated below:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
void cmdProcessSequence(cmd, objectTable, indirectCommandsLayout, pIndirectCommandsTokens, s)
{
  for (c = 0; c < indirectCommandsLayout.tokenCount; c++)
  {
    indirectCommandsLayout.pTokens[c].command (cmd, objectTable, pIndirectCommandsTokens[c], s);
  }
}

void cmdProcessAllSequences(cmd, objectTable, indirectCommandsLayout, pIndirectCommandsTokens, sequencesCount)
{
  for (s = 0; s < sequencesCount; s++)
  {
    cmdProcessSequence(cmd, objectTable, indirectCommandsLayout, pIndirectCommandsTokens, s);
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------

The processing of each sequence is considered stateless, therefore all state
changes must: occur prior work provoking commands within the sequence.
A single sequence is either strictly targeting
sname:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS or
ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE.

The primary input data for each token is provided through sname:VkBuffer
content at command generation time using flink:vkCmdProcessCommandsNVX,
however some functional arguments, for example binding sets, are specified
at layout creation time.
The input size is different for each token.

// refBegin VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenNVX Struct specifying the details of an indirect command layout token

The sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenNVX structure specifies details to
the function arguments that need to be known at layout creation time:

include::../../api/structs/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenNVX.txt[]

 * pname:type specifies the token command type.
 * pname:bindingUnit has a different meaning depending on the type, please
   refer pseudo code further down for details.
 * pname:dynamicCount has a different meaning depending on the type, please
   refer pseudo code further down for details.
 * pname:divisor defines the rate at which the input data buffers are
   accessed.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:bindingUnit must: stay within device supported limits for the
    appropriate commands.
  * pname:dynamicCount must: stay within device supported limits for the
    appropriate commands.
  * pname:divisor must: be greater than `0` and a power of two.
****

// refBegin VkIndirectCommandsTokenNVX Structure specifying parameters for the reservation of command buffer space

The sname:VkIndirectCommandsTokenNVX structure specifies the input data for
a token at processing time.

include::../../api/structs/VkIndirectCommandsTokenNVX.txt[]

  * pname:tokenType specifies the token command type.
  * pname:buffer specifies the sname:VkBuffer storing the functional
    arguments for each squence.
    These argumetns can be written by the device.
  * pname:offset specified an offset into pname:buffer where the arguments
    start.

.Valid Usage
****
  * The pname:buffer's usage flag must: have the
    ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDIRECT_BUFFER_BIT bit set.
  * The pname:offset must: be aligned to
    sname:VkDeviceGeneratedCommandsLimitsNVX::pname:minCommandsTokenBufferOffsetAlignment.

=== Creation and Deletion

Indirect command layouts are created by:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the object table.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkObjectTableCreateInfoNVX structure containing parameters
    affecting creation of the table.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pIndirectCommandsLayout points to a sname:VkObjectTableNVX handle
    in which the resulting object table is returned.

include::../../validity/protos/vkCreateIndirectCommandsLayoutNVX.txt[]

// refBegin VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoNVX Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created indirect commands layout object

The sname:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoNVX structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutCreateInfoNVX.txt[]

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint is the sname:VkPipelineBindPoint that this
    layout targets.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask providing usage hints of this layout.
    See elink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutUsageFlagBitsNVX below for a
    description of the supported bits.
  * pname:tokenCount is the length of the individual command sequnce.
  * pname:pTokens is an array describing each command token in detail.
    See elink:VkIndirectCommandsTokenTypeNVX and
    slink:VkIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenNVX below for details.

// refBegin VkIndirectCommandsLayoutUsageFlagBitsNVX Bitmask specifying allowed usage of a indirect commands layout

Bits which can: be set in pname:flags are:

include::../../api/enums/VkIndirectCommandsLayoutUsageFlagBitsNVX.txt[]

  * ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_UNORDERED_SEQUENCES_BIT_NVX
    indicates that the processing of sequences can: happen at an
    implementation-dependent order, which is not guaranteed to be coherent
    across multiple invocations.
  * ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_SPARSE_SEQUENCES_BIT_NVX
    indicates that there is likely a high difference between allocated
    number of sequences and actually used.
  * ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_EMPTY_EXECUTIONS_BIT_NVX
    indicates that there is likely many draw or dispatch calls that are
    zero-sized (zero grid dimension, no primitives to render).
  * ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_INDEXED_SEQUENCES_BIT_NVX
    indicates that the input data for the sequences is not implicitly
    indexed from 0..sequencesUsed but a user provided sname:VkBuffer
    encoding the index is provided.

The following code illustrates some of the key flags:

[source,c]
---------------------------------------------------
void cmdProcessAllSequences(cmd, objectTable, indirectCommandsLayout, pIndirectCommandsTokens, sequencesCount, indexbuffer, indexbufferoffset)
{
  for (s = 0; s < sequencesCount; s++)
  {
    sequence = s;

    if (indirectCommandsLayout.flags & VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_UNORDERED_SEQUENCES_BIT_NVX) {
      sequence = incoherent_implementation_dependent_permutation[ sequence ];
    }
    if (indirectCommandsLayout.flags & VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_INDEXED_SEQUENCES_BIT_NVX) {
      sequence = indexbuffer.load_uint32( sequence * sizeof(uint32_t) + indexbufferoffset);
    }

    cmdProcessSequence( cmd, objectTable, indirectCommandsLayout, pIndirectCommandsTokens, sequence );
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:tokenCount must: be greater than `0` and below
    sname:VkDeviceGeneratedCommandsLimitsNVX::pname:maxIndirectCommandsLayoutTokenCount
  * If the
    sname:VkDeviceGeneratedCommandsFeaturesNVX::pname:computeBindingPointSupport
    feature is not enabled, then pname:pipelineBindPoint must: not be
    ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE
  * If pname:pTokens contains an entry of
    ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_TOKEN_PIPELINE_NVX it must: be the first
    element of the array and there must: be only a single element of such
    token type.
  * All state binding tokens in pname:pTokens must: occur prior work
    provoking tokens (ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_TOKEN_DRAW_NVX,
    ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_TOKEN_DRAW_INDEXED_NVX,
    ename:VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_TOKEN_DISPATCH_NVX).

    token.
