The +VK_NN_vi_surface+ extension is an instance extension.
It provides a mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by
the +VK_KHR_surface+ extension) associated with an
code:nn::code:vi::code:Layer.

=== Issues

1) Does VI need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
physical device (and queue family?) and a specific VI display?

*RESOLVED*: No.
It is currently always assumed that the device and display will always be
compatible.

2) slink:VkViSurfaceCreateInfoNN::pname:pWindow is intended to store an
code:nn::code:vi::code:NativeWindowHandle, but its declared type is a bare
code:void* to store the window handle.
Why the discrepancy?

*RESOLVED*: It is for C compatibility.
The definition for the VI native window handle type is defined inside the
nn::vi C++ namespace.
This prevents its use in C source files.
nn::vi::NativeWindowHandle is always defined to be void*, so this
extension uses void* to match.
