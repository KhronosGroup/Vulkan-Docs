An application using external memory may wish to synchronize access to that
memory using fences.
This extension enables an application to create fences from which non-Vulkan
handles that reference the underlying synchronization primitive can be
exported.

=== New Object Types

None.

=== New Enum Constants

  * ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_EXPORT_FENCE_CREATE_INFO_KHR

=== New Enums

  * elink:VkFenceImportFlagBitsKHR

=== New Structs

  * slink:VkExportFenceCreateInfoKHR

=== New Functions

None.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.

=== Issues

This extension borrows concepts, semantics, and language from
`<<VK_KHR_external_semaphore>>`.
That extension's issues apply equally to this extension.
