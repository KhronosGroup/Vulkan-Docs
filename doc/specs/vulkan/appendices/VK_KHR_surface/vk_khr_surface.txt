The VK_KHR_surface extension is an instance extension.  It introduces
sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects, which abstract native platform surface or window
objects for use with Vulkan.  It also provides a way to determine whether a
queue family in a physical device supports presenting to particular surface.

Separate extensions for each each platform
provide the mechanisms for creating sname:VkSurfaceKHR objects, but once created they
may be used in this and other platform-independent extensions, in particular
the VK_KHR_swapchain extension.

=== New Object Types

  * sname:VkSurfaceKHR

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending ename:VkResult:
  ** ename:VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR
  ** ename:VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR

=== New Enums

  * ename:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR
  * ename:VkPresentModeKHR
  * ename:VkColorSpaceKHR
  * ename:VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR
  * slink:VkSurfaceFormatKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkDestroySurfaceKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR

=== Examples

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The example code for the VK_KHR_surface and VK_KHR_swapchain extensions will be
removed from future versions of this appendix.  The WSI example code was ported
to the cube demo, that is shipped with the official Khronos SDK, and has been
kept up-to-date in that location.  There is little reason to maintain this
example code in the appendix as well.
====

**Example 1**

Show how to obtain function pointers for WSI commands.  Most applications
should not need to do this, because the functions for the WSI extensions that
are relevant for a given platform are exported by the official loader for that
platform (e.g. the official Khronos loader for Microsoft Windows and Linux,
and the Android loader).  Other examples, will directly call the relevant
command, not through a function pointer.

=== Issues

1) Should this extension include a method to query whether a physical
   device supports presenting to a specific window or native surface
   on a given platform?

   RESOLVED: Yes.  Without this, applications would need to create
   a device instance to determine whether a particular window can be
   presented to.  Knowing that a device supports presentation to a
   platform in general is not sufficient, as a single machine might
   support multiple seats, or instances of the platform that each use
   different underlying physical devices.  Additionally, some platforms,
   such as X windows, different drivers and devices might be used for
   different windows depending on which section of the desktop they
   exist on.

2) Should the vkGetSurfacePropertiesKHR(), vkGetSurfaceFormatsKHR(), and
   vkGetSurfacePresentModesKHR() functions from
   VK_KHR_swapchain be modified to operate on physical devices and
   moved to this extension to implement the resolution of issue 1?

   RESOLVED: No, separate query functions are needed, as the purposes
   served are similar but incompatible.  The vkGetSurface*KHR functions
   return information that could potentially depend on an initialized
   device.  For example, the formats supported for presentation to the
   surface might vary depending on which device extensions are enabled.
   The query introduced to resolve issue 1 should be used only to query
   generic driver or platform properties.  The physical device
   parameter is intended to serve only as an identifier rather than
   a stateful object.

3) Should Vulkan include support Xlib or XCB as the API for accessing
   the X Window System platform?

   RESOLVED: Both.  XCB is a more modern and efficient API, but Xlib
   usage is deeply ingrained in many applications and likely will remain
   in use for the foreseeable future.  Not all drivers necessarily need to
   support both, but including both as options in the core specification
   will probably encourage support, which should in turn eases adoption of
   the Vulkan API in older codebases.  Additionally, the performance
   improvements possible with XCB likely won't have a measurable impact
   on the performance of Vulkan presentation and other minimal window
   system interactions defined here.

4) Should the GBM platform be included in the list of platform enums?

   RESOLVED: Deferred, and will be addressed with a platform-specific
   extension to be written in the future.

=== Version History

 * Revision 1, 2015-05-20 (James Jones)
   - Initial draft, based on LunarG KHR spec, other KHR specs,
     patches attached to bugs.

 * Revision 2, 2015-05-22 (Ian Elliott)
   - Created initial Description section.
   - Removed query for whether a platform requires the use of a queue for
     presentation, since it was decided that presentation will always be
     modeled as being part of the queue.
   - Fixed typos and other minor mistakes.

 * Revision 3, 2015-05-26 (Ian Elliott)
   - Improved the Description section.

 * Revision 4, 2015-05-27 (James Jones)
   - Fixed compilation errors in example code.

 * Revision 5, 2015-06-01 (James Jones)
   - Added issues 1 and 2 and made related spec updates.

 * Revision 6, 2015-06-01 (James Jones)
   - Merged the platform type mappings table previously removed from
     VK_KHR_swapchain with the platform description table in this
     spec.
   - Added issues 3 and 4 documenting choices made when building the
     initial list of native platforms supported.

 * Revision 7, 2015-06-11 (Ian Elliott)
   - Updated table 1 per input from the KHR TSG.
   - Updated issue 4 (GBM) per discussion with Daniel Stone.  He will
     create a platform-specific extension sometime in the future.

 * Revision 8, 2015-06-17 (James Jones)
   - Updated enum-extending values using new convention.
   - Fixed the value of VK_SURFACE_PLATFORM_INFO_TYPE_SUPPORTED_KHR.

 * Revision 9, 2015-06-17 (James Jones)
   - Rebased on Vulkan API version 126.

 * Revision 10, 2015-06-18 (James Jones)
   - Marked issues 2 and 3 resolved.

 * Revision 11, 2015-06-23 (Ian Elliott)
   - Examples now show use of function pointers for extension functions.
   - Eliminated extraneous whitespace.

 * Revision 12, 2015-07-07 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Added error section describing when each error is expected to be
     reported.
   - Replaced the term "queue node index" with "queue family index" in
     the spec as that is the agreed term to be used in the latest
     version of the core header and spec.
   - Replaced bool32_t with VkBool32.

 * Revision 13, 2015-08-06 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Updated spec against latest core API header version.

 * Revision 14, 2015-08-20 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed this extension and all of its enumerations, types, functions,
     etc.  This makes it compliant with the proposed standard for Vulkan
     extensions.
   - Switched from "revision" to "version", including use of the
     VK_MAKE_VERSION macro in the header file.
   - Did miscellaneous cleanup, etc.

 * Revision 15, 2015-08-20 (Ian Elliott--porting a 2015-07-29 change from
   James Jones)
   - Moved the surface transform enums here from VK_WSI_swapchain so they
     could be re-used by VK_WSI_display.

 * Revision 16, 2015-09-01 (James Jones)
   - Restore single-field revision number.

 * Revision 17, 2015-09-01 (James Jones)
   - Fix example code compilation errors.

 * Revision 18, 2015-09-26 (Jesse Hall)
   - Replaced VkSurfaceDescriptionKHR with the VkSurfaceKHR object, which
     is created via layered extensions. Added VkDestroySurfaceKHR.

   - Renamed from VK_EXT_KHR_swapchain to VK_EXT_KHR_surface.

 * Revision 20, 2015-09-30 (Jeff Vigil)
   - Add error result VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR.

 * Revision 21, 2015-10-15 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Updated the resolution of issue #2 and include the surface capability
     queries in this extension.
   - Renamed SurfaceProperties to SurfaceCapabilities as it better
     reflects that the values returned are the capabilities of the surface
     on a particular device.
   - Other minor cleanup and consistency changes.

 * Revision 22, 2015-10-26 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed from VK_EXT_KHR_surface to VK_KHR_surface.

 * Revision 23, 2015-11-03 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Added allocation callbacks to vkDestroySurfaceKHR.

   - Moved VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR from the VK_KHR_android_surface to
     the VK_KHR_surface extension.

 * 2016-08-23 (Ian Elliott)
   - Update the example code, to not have so many characters per line, and to
     split out a new example to show how to obtain function pointers.

 * 2016-08-25 (Ian Elliott)
   - A note was added at the beginning of the example code, stating that it
     will be removed from future versions of the appendix.
