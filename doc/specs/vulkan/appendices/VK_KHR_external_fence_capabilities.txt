An application may wish to reference device fences in multiple Vulkan
logical devices or instances, in multiple processes, and/or in multiple
APIs.
This extension provides a set of capability queries and handle definitions
that allow an application to determine what types of "`external`" fence
handles an implementation supports for a given set of use cases.

=== New Object Types

None.

=== New Enum Constants

  * ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_EXTERNAL_FENCE_INFO_KHR
  * ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_EXTERNAL_FENCE_PROPERTIES_KHR
  * ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_PROPERTIES_KHR
  * ename:VK_LUID_SIZE_KHR

=== New Enums

  * elink:VkExternalFenceHandleTypeFlagBitsKHR
  * elink:VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBitsKHR

=== New Structs

  * slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalFenceInfoKHR
  * slink:VkExternalFencePropertiesKHR
  * slink:VkPhysicalDeviceIDPropertiesKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceExternalFencePropertiesKHR

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.

=== Issues

None.
