device's display without any underlying window system.

=== Issues

1)  Should swapchains sharing images each hold a reference to the images,
    or should it be up to the application to destroy the swapchains and
    images in an order that avoids the need for reference counting?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Take a reference.  The lifetime of presentable
    images is already complex enough.

2)  Should the srcRect/dstRect parameters be specified as part of the
    present command, or at swapchain creation time?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: As part of the presentation command.  This allows
    moving and scaling the image on the screen without the need to
    respecify the mode or create a new swapchain presentable images.

3)  Should srcRect/dstRect be specified as rects, or separate offset/extent
    values?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: As rects.  Specifying them separately might make
    it easier for hardware to expose support for one but not the other, but
    in such cases applications must just take care to obey the reported
    capabilities and not use non-zero offsets or extents that require
    scaling, as appropriate.

4)  How can applications create multiple swapchains that use the same
    images?

    RESOLUTION: By calling vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR().

    An earlier resolution used vkCreateSwapchainKHR(), chaining multiple
    VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structures through pNext.  In order to allow each
    swapchain to also allow other extension structs, a level of indirection
    was used: VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR::pNext pointed to a different structure,
    which had both an sType/pNext for additional extensions, and also had a
    pointer to the next VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure.  The number of
    swapchains to be created could only be found by walking this linked list
    of alternating structures, and the pSwapchains out parameter was
    reinterpreted to be an array of VkSwapchainKHR handles.

    Another option considered was a method to specify a "shared"
    swapchain when creating a new swapchain, such that groups of swapchains
    using the same images could be built up one at a time.  This was deemed
    unusable because drivers need to know all of the displays an image
    will be used on when determining which internal formats and layouts to
    use for that image.

=== Examples

**Example 1**

Create a swapchain on a display mode and plane

[source,{basebackend@docbook:C++:cpp}]
----------------------------------------
    // See VK_KHR_display for an example of how to pick a display,
    // display mode, plane, and how to create a VkSurfaceKHR for
    // that plane.
    extern VkPhysicalDevice physDevice;
    extern VkDisplayModePropertiesKHR myModeProps;
    extern VkSurfaceKHR mySurface;
    extern VkDevice device;

    uint32_t queueCount, i;
    uint32_t presentQueueFamilyIndex = UINT32_MAX;
    VkBool32 supportsPresent;

    // Find a queue family that supports presenting to this surface
    uint32_t familyCount;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(physDevice, &familyCount, NULL);

    for (i = 0; i < familyCount; ++i)
    {
        vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR(physDevice, i, mySurface, &supportsPresent);

        if (supportsPresent) {
            // Found a queue family that supports present.  See
            // VK_KHR_surface for an example of how to find a queue that
            // supports both presentation and graphics
            presentQueueFamilyIndex = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Figure out which formats and present modes this surface supports.
    uint32_t formatCount;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR(physDevice, mySurface, &formatCount, NULL);

    VkSurfaceFormatKHR* formats = (VkSurfaceFormatKHR*)malloc(sizeof(VkSurfaceFormatKHR) * formatCount);
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR(physDevice, mySurface, &formatCount, formats);

    const VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR createInfo =
    {
        VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_INFO_KHR,    // sType

        formats[0].format,                              // imageFormat
        formats[0].colorSpace,                          // imageColorSpace
        myModeProps.parameters.visibleRegion,           // imageExtent
        1,                                              // imageArrayLayers
        VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT,            // imageUsage
        VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE,                      // imageSharingMode
        0,                                              // queueFamilyIndexCount
        NULL,                                           // pQueueFamilyIndices
        VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR,          // preTransform
        VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR,              // compositeAlpha
        VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR,                       // presentMode
        VK_TRUE,                                        // clipped
        VK_NULL_HANDLE                                  // oldSwapchain
    };

    VkSwapchainKHR swapchain;
    // This is equivalent to vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
    vkCreateSharedSwapchainsKHR(device, 1, &createInfo, NULL, &swapchain);
