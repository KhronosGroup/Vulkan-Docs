This extension has the same goal as the OpenGL{nbsp}ES +GL_OVR_multiview+
extension - it enables rendering to multiple "`views`" by recording a single
set of commands to be executed with slightly different behavior for each
view.
It includes a concise way to declare a render pass with multiple views, and
gives implementations freedom to render the views in the most efficient way
possible.
