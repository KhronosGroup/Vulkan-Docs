The VK_KHR_xlib_surface extension is an instance extension.  It provides a
mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by the
VK_KHR_surface extension) that refers to an X11 window, using the Xlib
client-side library, as well as a query to determine support for rendering via
Xlib.

=== New Object Types

None

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending ename:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_XLIB_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR

=== New Enums

None

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceXlibPresentationSupportKHR

=== Issues

1) Does X11 need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
   physical device and a specific screen?  This would be a more general query
   than vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR: If it returned true, then the
   physical device could be assumed to support presentation to any window on
   that screen.

   RESOLVED: Yes, this is needed for toolkits that want to create a VkDevice
   before creating a window.  To ensure the query is reliable, it must be
   made against a particular X visual rather than the screen in general.

=== Version History

 * Revision 1, 2015-09-23 (Jesse Hall)
   - Initial draft, based on the previous contents of VK_EXT_KHR_swapchain
     (later renamed VK_EXT_KHR_surface).

 * Revision 2, 2015-10-02 (James Jones)
   - Added presention support query for (Display*, VisualID) pair.
   - Removed "root" parameter from CreateXlibSurfaceKHR(), as it is
     redundant when a window on the same screen is specified as well.
   - Added appropriate X errors.
   - Adjusted wording of issue #1 and added agreed upon resolution.

 * Revision 3, 2015-10-14 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed this extension from VK_EXT_KHR_x11_surface to
     VK_EXT_KHR_xlib_surface.

 * Revision 4, 2015-10-26 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed from VK_EXT_KHR_xlib_surface to VK_KHR_xlib_surface.

 * Revision 5, 2015-11-03 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Added allocation callbacks to vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR.

 * Revision 6, 2015-11-28 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Updated the surface create function to take a pCreateInfo structure.
