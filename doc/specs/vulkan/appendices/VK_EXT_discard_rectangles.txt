This extension provides additional orthogonally aligned "`discard
rectangles`" specified in framebuffer-space coordinates that restrict
rasterization of all points, lines and triangles.

From zero to an implementation-dependent limit (specified by
pname:maxDiscardRectangles) number of discard rectangles can be operational
at once.
When one or more discard rectangles are active, rasterized fragments can
either survive if the fragment is within any of the operational discard
rectangles (ename:VK_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_MODE_INCLUSIVE_EXT mode) or be
rejected if the fragment is within any of the operational discard rectangles
(ename:VK_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_MODE_EXCLUSIVE_EXT mode).

These discard rectangles operate orthogonally to the existing scissor test
functionality.
If the `<<VK_KHX_device_group>>` extension is enabled the discard rectangles
can be different for each physical device in the device group by specifying
the device mask and setting discard rectangle dynamic state.
