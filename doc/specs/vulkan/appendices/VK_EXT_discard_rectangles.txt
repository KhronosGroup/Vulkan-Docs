This extension provides additional orthogonally aligned "`discard
rectangles`" specified in framebuffer-space coordinates that restrict
rasterization of all points, lines and triangles.

From zero to an implementation-dependent limit (specified by
pname:maxDiscardRectangles) number of discard rectangles can: be operational
at once.
When one or more discard rectangles are active, rasterized fragments
either survive if the fragment is within any of the operational discard
rectangles (ename:VK_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_MODE_INCLUSIVE_EXT mode), or be
rejected if the fragment is within any of the operational discard rectangles
(ename:VK_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_MODE_EXCLUSIVE_EXT mode).

These discard rectangles operate orthogonally to the existing scissor test
functionality.
If the <<VK_KHX_device_group,`VK_KHX_device_group`>> extension is enabled
the discard rectangles can: be different for each physical device in the
device group by specifying the device mask and setting discard rectangle
dynamic state.
