This extension provides versions of flink:vkBindBufferMemory and
flink:vkBindImageMemory that allow multiple bindings to be performed at
once, and are extensible.

This extension also introduces ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_ALIAS_BIT_KHR, which
allows "`identical`" images that alias the same memory to interpret the
contents consistently, even across image layout changes.

=== New Object Types

None.

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending ename:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BIND_BUFFER_MEMORY_INFO_KHR
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BIND_IMAGE_MEMORY_INFO_KHR

  * Extending ename:VkImageCreateFlagBits:
  ** ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_ALIAS_BIT_KHR

=== New Enums

None.

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkBindBufferMemoryInfoKHR
  * slink:VkBindImageMemoryInfoKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkBindBufferMemory2KHR
  * flink:vkBindImageMemory2KHR

=== New Built-In Variables

None.

=== New SPIR-V Capabilities

None.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.

=== Issues

None.

=== Version History

 * Revision 1, 2017-05-19 (Tobias Hector)
   - Pulled bind memory functions into their own extension
